9,1b4nrvp,batgadget,Sony Investigation of Ransomware Attacks @ Insomniac Games,"PlayStation development company, Insomniac Games, may have fallen victim to a ransomware attack. The hacking group 'Rhysida' has claimed responsibility and says it has stolen sensitive data from the studio.

### Hackers Claim to Have Sensitive Info and Game Details

Rhysida alleges that it has obtained confidential Insomniac Games documents, emails, and employee personal information. More concerning for gamers, the group also claims to have images and details related to the upcoming Wolverine title currently in development.

Proof-of-hack files were published showing what appear to be Wolverine game screenshots and character artwork. Rhysida is threatening to sell the stolen data for $2 million if its ransom demands are not met within 7 days.

### Sony Investigating, Says Attack Limited to Insomniac Games

Sony issued a brief statement acknowledging the incident: ""We are aware of reports that Insomniac Games has been the victim of a cyber security attack. We are currently investigating this situation.”

Importantly, Sony clarified that the attack seems contained to Insomniac Games and has not spread to other Sony companies or divisions at this time.

### Background on Insomniac and Sony Hacking Issues

Insomniac Games is the acclaimed studio behind hits like Spyro, Ratchet & Clank, and recent Spider-Man games. Its Wolverine title was announced last year but does not yet have a release date.

Sony is no stranger to cyber attacks, having faced previous ransomware incidents impacting Sony employees. The company continues to be a prime target for hackers given its size and valuable intellectual property related to PlayStation and entertainment.

This developing story continues to unfold but Sony is actively working to investigate and contain the attack. Gamers eagerly await updates on the status of stolen Wolverine data and Insomniac's ability to continue development on the title.",2,1.0,1709384509,1

Seems a lot of the comments were saying that if they paid, the hackers wouldn't leak due to reputation. I wonder if it's different than the sextortion we've faced since it's millions of dollars we are talking about and a high level company. High volume, lower dollar figures for sextortion, low volume, higher dollar figures for ransomware attacks.

Interesting to think about given the advice we get is to NEVER PAY.

This ransomware attack took place December 19 2023. After refusing a 2-million dollar ransom, the hackers dumped 1.7 terabyte of 1.3 million files. Important reveals:*

............

***\*Marvel - Insomniac licensing terms for an upcoming game (X-men; one of 4 upcoming)***:

*In the late 2010's Iger closed Disney's gaming divisions retaining a small staff whose sole function is to license out & creatively cooperate and supervise: Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games...etc*. *The 2010's saw a shift in video gaming where emphasis shifted to making few games but of supreme quality, narrative and graphics. These games today are incredibly expensive costing at times $200-300mil*. *One of those games is Spiderman2 just released to become the fastest selling video game in Playstation history*. *In the leaks, licensing terms are defined by Marvel for the game developer:*

***-Conditions on budget:*** *each game gets at least* ***$120 million*** *for production and* ***$30*** *million for marketing.*

*-****Exclusivity:*** *Disney doesn't release licensed characters in any other video game; total of 4 up until* ***2035****.*

***-Marvel Royalties:*** *several tiers depending on number of sales. If sales are above 7 million units: Disney gets* ***26% of net digital sales*** *(includes DLCs),* ***18% of physical sales***\*, and finally\* ***50% of bundled games***\*.\*

*Disney has multiple deals with multiple game developers simultaneously. Marvel for example has deals with other game developers like Bethesda in addition to Insomniac. This also includes Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar...etc. All that royalty almost completely goes to their bottom line having only to finance a small staff for licensing.*

.............

***\*Microsoft's acquisition of Activision will leapfrog Sony past their current pillars:***

*Sony allegedly goes into detail about how it views Microsoft's position moving forward. Described by Sony as ""the leapfrog,"" the slide details how Microsoft is aiming to build a mobile gaming store to compete with Apple and Google, as per previous information. It also details how Microsoft could build a comprehensive ecosystem across mobile, PC, and console, referring to Xbox Game Pass as ""GP"" throughout. Sony details how its ""pillars"" are ""dated,"" and behind Microsoft, referring to Microsoft's growing service game portfolio across titles like Sea of Thieves, Halo Infinite, and Minecraft. Sony also notes its need to ""respond,"" although its service game efforts have hit snags recently, with Destiny's upcoming expansion delayed, and The Last of Us Online wholly cancelled.*

..............

***\*Video games have become more and more expensive, similar to films, compelling a change in strategy:***

*Sony details how difficult it's getting to actually get a return on investment for AAA games — an issue that is plaguing the entire industry right now. Sony expresses how a $500 million game might not break even in the first year, which is upending how publishers are thinking about platforms like PC and mobile as they seek profitability and less risky investments.*

*To that end, Sony's ""strategic pillars"" seem to detail an intent to eventually launch games more quickly, or even day one on Windows PCs, as part of its multi-platform pillar.*

 As it turns out, American users should not download and play the  early build of Wolverine, which is now freely available.  If they do  this, they will be breaking copyright law, and as recent social media  posts have shown, they are very easy to track. 

There have recently been reports on Twitter that Insomniac Games is  sending out DMCA notices through internet service providers (ISPs) such  as US-based Comcast.  It's all too easy for these corporations to track  your online activity, which of course includes illegally downloading and  distributing development builds of games that were leaked during data  theft. 

One of the messages that appeared on Twitter emphasizes that this was done by Comcast: 

>The copyright owner has identified the IP address associated  with your Xfinity Internet account at this time as the source of the  infringing work... We remind you that using our service in any way that  constitutes copyright infringement is a violation of the DMCA Policy  from Comcast and may result in termination of service and termination of  your account. 

The DMCA notice captured everything from the time and date of the  upload to the specific file name of the dev build - absolutely nothing  escaped your ISP. 

Just a few days ago, more than a terabyte of stolen data was  transferred to Insomniac Games by a group of ransomware who were unable  to receive any funds for the content.  These included roadmaps,  developer builds, code, and personal information from past and present  employees.  The move caused a lot of buzz online, and in the days that  followed, numerous spoilers for the upcoming Wolverine game circulated  on social media. ",1,1.0,1703239115,1

Hey, everyone! 

This is a quick update that we have decided to change our policy surrounding how leaked information is handled within the subreddit.

As you may have seen prior to this post, the Insomniac Games ransomware attack was handled by putting all discussion in a megathread that ultimately wasn’t as supportive or helpful as it could’ve been in, making us realise we need to take a different approach towards leaks if we are to properly support Insomniac Games moving forward and any future companies who may have their employee’s hard work undermined and spoiled.

This has led to us creating a new rule: 

**Rule 8: No *sharing of* leaked information.** 

~~This new rule prohibits all discussion and sharing of leaked information, regardless on whether it is related to the Marvel’s Spider-Man series or not.~~

***This new rule allows discussion of leaks but prevents the sharing of leaked information by links, images, videos or other means.***

This not only stops all leaked information being shared ~~or discussed~~, but will additionally cover future games, where spoilers are shared prior to the game release, like we had with SM2.

We hope you understand while we have made this decision and if you wish to know more about this rule, you can read the description in the Rules tab.

Thanks, everyone!",7,0.53,1703282349,1

Now, various internal documents released online as part of a malicious ransomware hack suggest just how hard this has been to pull off, with studio leaders juggling teams, timelines, and budgets like Tetris blocks in order to ship games that aren’t just excellent but also profitable. They also hint that possible cutbacks within Sony Worldwide Studios may only be adding to the challenge.

The hacker group threatened to leak all received files if  Sony did not pay.  It looks like they weren't kidding, because that's  exactly what happened: Marvel's Wolverine build and several videos,  including the first gameplay footage, were leaked!

 Obviously, this is very early footage of the game, and like the Grand  Theft Auto 6 leak, it shouldn't be an indication of what the final game  will be like. 

Other leaks indicate that the main campaign will last approximately 15 hours and even  concept art of the game  with the cast, which contains a huge amount of spoilers. 

The list of locations has also become known: Alaska, Avalon, Canada, Japan and Madripoor 

Now that all of this has been revealed, we're not sure what this  means for Insomniac Games as it could result in the game being delayed. 

Of course, there's a good chance that some of the leaked information  is from an early build or is based on an old or outdated version of the  game.  Consider this before anything else

116,1906v0e,LastStandMedia,"Sacred Symbols+, Episode 361 | Dissecting the Insomniac Leak",">Right after we went away on our holiday vacation, a major piece of news  dropped that rocked the industry in the form of a wide-ranging leak of  data from Sony-owned Insomniac Games. Timing stopped us from responding  until now, and we're going to do so in great detail today. See, our job  on Sacred Symbols isn't to make the news, but rather to report on and  react to it. While what befell Insomniac isn't right or good -- and  while it certainly isn't legal -- it did, in fact, happen. And our  coverage of it shouldn't signal our approval of the situation, anymore  than a local newspaper reporter covering a murder. We have to  acknowledge reality, and incorporate new knowledge. It's important to  note that most of what was in the leak isn't going to be featured in any  way on this podcast, and indeed, we don't even know how to interact  with the leaked materials directly, nor do we care to learn. Instead,  through the likes of Reddit, Imgur, forums, and social media, we  collected what we thought was relevant, and left out the rest. The  relevant: Insomniac's release schedule, game financials, sales data, PS+  presentations, and other items of acute business interest. The  irrelevant: Any details having to do with a game deeper than its mere  existence. No plot or character spoilers, no discussions on builds and  videos, no artwork analysis, and so on. And it goes without saying that  personal details of any kind (which we frankly didn't personally  encounter while researching for this podcast to begin with) are complete  nonstarters. We hope you find our coverage fair and thoughtful; we'll  leave that determination up to you.

123,18mbo18,spiderman2,Is anyone else not really looking forward to that one upcoming leaked Insomniac game?,"Pretty much, I’m honesty not that excited for the Venom spinoff.

I know this was expected, Venom was barely playable in Spider-Man 2, there was a lot of Venom content made that wasn’t put in the game, and Spider-Man PS4 got a spinoff 2 years from launch also.

But man at this point I’m just kinda burnt out on Insomniac Spider-Man. Maybe it’s just because I played Miles Morales a month before  I played Spider-Man 2 but I don’t think I’m ready for another game in that formula any time soon, at least any time before Wolverine.

I don’t know if this is an unpopular opinion, but the Venom section wasn’t really that for me in Spider-Man 2, felt too stiff without a lot of the impact and freedom of the Spider-Men. I know this spinoff would obviously expand upon his capabilities but I don’t think the foundation is that fun.

I like the Spider-Man formula but I think a break would be for the best. It’s been the same map and same core mechanics for the past 3 entries, I’m ready for a break.

I know it being $50 makes it more attractive but like, there’s so many fresh experiences in this industry you can get for $50 or cheaper. Just next month is the really great looking Prince of Persia game for $50, not to mention all of the indies that could explode onto the scene.",0,0.26,1703017812,1

128,18svr4a,insomniacleaks,Clarification on Spider-Man 2 (SM2) Leak Situation and Misinformation,"I wanted to bring some clarity to the recent events surrounding the leak of data from Insomniac Games, particularly the Spider-Man 2 (SM2) source code, and the subsequent claims made by ""*PC\_Focus\_*"" on Twitter.

&#x200B;

**Background:**  
As many of you are aware, Insomniac Games, the developers behind Spider-Man for PS4, recently fell victim to a hacking incident, resulting in the leak of a substantial amount of data, including the source code for Spider-Man 2.

**Misinformation:**  
One user, ""PC\_Focus\_"", has been actively promoting the idea that they can make Spider-Man 2 work on other platforms, particularly on PC.

In their latest post, PC\_Focus\_ mentioned having the files for Spider-Man 2 but lacking the assets. This statement is puzzling because, as per the leaked information, the necessary assets should be available. Additionally, they claimed to have obtained all the build files and almost all the assets in a post on December 26th, only to backtrack on this claim the following day.

**Questionable Claims:**  
It's important to be cautious about what PC\_Focus\_ is saying. They talked about trying to get files from the PS5, saying they had the passcodes from a leak. But, it's unclear if they actually succeeded or not. It seems a bit confusing because, technically, they should have been able to if they had the right codes. This makes it hard to trust their information. It would help if they could explain the technical details better and clear up any contradictions.

**Insomniac's PC Testing:**  
There have been speculations about the existence of a PC version of Spider-Man 2, suggesting that Insomniac Games might have created it for testing purposes. While it's plausible that developers use PC versions for testing, It's unclear whether this version was fully realized or how far along it progressed before being shelved.

**Clarification on ImGui:**  
There have been assertions that the presence of ImGui (a bloat-free GUI) indicates a PC version. It's essential to correct the misconception that ImGui is exclusive to PC. In fact, there are PS4/PS5 ports for ImGui, debunking the idea that its presence implies a PC version of the game.

**Conclusion**: Don't trust everyone on the internet.

EDIT:// Also forgot to mention, we never even saw a picture of the ""Spider Man 2"" port running.",15,0.71,1703775320,1
143,1971xne,Games_Piracy,"The PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has begun to appear on torrents, weighing more than 250 GB"," At the end of last year, developers from the Insomniac Games studio were  hacked, resulting in the largest data leak about future projects.   Among the data published by hackers was a fully playable PC version of  the popular superhero action game Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Almost a month  after this, enthusiasts managed to create a truly working build of the  game for PC and publish it to the public, but its overall size is a  little scary.  

https://preview.redd.it/nkt5r6cerjcc1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ea2aaeb8b87f07b95d573f57b743394f53ec4a0

 Reportedly, the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has begun to  appear on major platforms, which was compiled into a working build by  enthusiasts.  Users had to sift through over a terabyte of data to find  all the necessary components to run the game, ending up with a build  that weighed over 250GB. 

Such a huge size of the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is due to  the fact that the build included a huge number of original assets and  textures that did not go through the compression procedure.  According  to players, the build generally works well on mid-range PCs, but now  requires an extremely powerful processor and a very fast SSD to avoid  loading. 

Meanwhile, the release date for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC remains  officially unknown.  The project has not even been announced for this  platform, but given the leak, this could happen soon. ",3,1.0,1705299674,1

For consecutive 8 years from **2009 to 2016**, Bitcoin remained the currency of the Darknet community and the Elite’s for tax evasion. No one was well versed with how Bitcoin works, who was Satoshi Nakamoto and what exactly is the blockchain network.

The discussion was limited to bitcoin forums and tech blogs but it was not a talk of the **general public**. 

 Most of you might have never heard of Bitcoin before 2017 as much as you hear it today. It has become the discussion of almost everyone from your **Uber driver** to your youngsters. Almost everyone now talks about investing in bitcoin. People have started taking loans in order to invest in cryptocurrencies. 

 

Before 2017, there was less public and media attention towards bitcoin. In order to take everyone by surprise and force the entire world to talk about bitcoin, bitcoin inventors needed **something exceptional**.

What could have been more productive and effective than a worldwide **WannaCry Ransomware attack!**WannaCry Ransomware attack took place between 12 May 2017 – 15 May 2017. During a span of just 4 days, it infected more than **300,000** **computers**, across **150** **countries** and causing a loss of billions of dollars.

WannaCry is a ransomware cryptoworm, which only targeted computers running Windows OS by encrypting files and demanding ransom payments of $300 – $600 via **Bitcoin**. The cyberattack mainly targeted users of **Windows XP**, an outdated Windows OS for which Microsoft largely ended support in 2014.

Victim computer was locked and he could do nothing but watch a welcome message screen containing information that guided the victim to **pay bitcoins** on the mentioned public **BTC address** in order to unlock the computer.

The attacker was so fond of Bitcoins that he accepted no other payment system except bitcoin. If you observe the Wannacry screenshot below, you will notice that it looks less like a ransomware and more like an **advertisement poster** promoting Bitcoin with full user guide such as:  


***About bitcoin,***  
***How to buy bitcoin,***  
***Bitcoin accepted here*****.**  


**A perfect Bitcoin promotional poster!** 

 WannaCry Ransomware took social media and mainstream media **on fire**. 

 

After WannaCry Ransomware attack, Bitcoin price increased by over **931%** within **7 months!** Contrary to its **8 years** of no exceptional price movement except for 2013 when prices were moved from **$150** to **$1000** using trading robots.

Note: Apart from this publicity stunt, another big player that led to this soaring Bitcoin prices was cross trading between exchanged using the cryptocurrency called **Tether** that we discussed in Chapter#2.0

### Any guesses for the architecture behind WannaCry Attack?

None other than American Government’s “**National Security Agency**” aka **NSA**.

USA tried its best to put all the blame for WannaCry on North Korea as usual but this time NSA’s own mistakes exposed it badly.

The **EternalBlue exploit** which was used in WannaCry Ransomware Attack **was developed** by none other than the U.S. [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency) (NSA) according to testimony by former NSA employees.

NSA had **already discovered** the EternalBlue vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, but instead of reporting it to Microsoft, which could prevent this worldwide Wannacry attack, NSA used it to create an exploit for its own **offensive work**.

EternalBlue was leaked in April 14, 2017 which was then integrated in WannaCry and launched in May 12, 2017.  
Throughout this one month gap (code leak and attack launch), **NSA kept its mouth shut** and did not inform Microsoft to release security patches for older versions of windows.

As a result of this cyberattack more than **200,000** computers across **150** countries got affected, causing **billions of dollars loss**.

When independent researchers started stopping this attack, Edward Snowden, former NSA contractor, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/snowden/status/863422022994481152?lang=en) this by sharing a Guardian link:

>*When* [*~~@~~****NSAGov***](https://twitter.com/NSAGov)*-enabled ransomware eats the internet, help comes from researchers, not spy agencies. Amazing story.*

 

As soon as the world realized that NSA was behind this massive **Bitcoin Ransomware attack**, several security experts and world leaders expressed their anger over NSA's non-disclosure of the EternalBlue vulnerability.

Russian President [**Vladimir Putin**](http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2017/05/15/actualidad/1494855826_022843.html) placed the responsibility of the attack on NSA, for having created EternalBlue.

*British cyber security expert* ***Graham Cluley*** [*said*](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-nsa-cyberattacks-20170513-story.html)*:*

>*“****they*** ***\[NSA\]*** ***could have done something*** *ages ago to get this problem fixed, and* ***they didn't do it****"".*

When USA tried blaming North Korea for the attack, this is what a former NSA analyst Jake Williams [said](https://www.wired.com/story/korea-accountable-wannacry-nsa-eternal-blue/):

>“*To have a discussion about accountability for North Korea without the discussion of how they got the material for the attack in the first place is* ***irresponsible*** *at best, and* ***deceptive*** *at worst.*  
*North Korea couldn't have done this* ***without us****. We enabled the operation by losing control of those tools.”*

Microsoft president Brad Smith [said](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/ransomware-attack-like-having-a-tomahawk-missile-stolen-says-microsoft-boss):

>*""Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its* ***Tomahawk missiles*** ***stolen.****""*

NSA being the **designer** of Bitcoin hashing algorithm SHA-256, NSA being responsible for WannaCry RansomWare Attack for **Bitcoin promotion** and **Nick** **Szabo’s** (Satoshi’s) **secret** meetings with U.S government’s top officials, is enough evidence to prove “**Who cooked the Bitcoin recipe**” ",0,0.48,1712582043,2

---

**Note:** When I refer to **Petya** in this post, I'm referring to the malware strain that's currently spreading around the world. This also goes by the name of **GoldenEye**, **NotPetya**, and **Petwrap**. According to Kapersky, this virus is unrelated to the earlier strains of Petya (hence NotPetya), but both because a lot of this remains applicable regardless and because I'm lazy I'm not going to change this.

# What's happening?

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts all of your files and tells you to pay a certain amount of money to get the decryption key. This type of malware has been steadily becoming more and more popular over the past few years, especially because the payout for a successful campaign can be quite lucrative. A very high profile ransomware attack occurred last month in the form of WannaCry, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers and interrupted work globally. This strain of ransomware was notable because it had the ability to spread to other computers over a network, which allowed it to spread much more effectively than otherwise.

Petya is a particular family of malware that has been notable for its ruthlessness. While most ransomware strains simply infect your files, leaving the computer otherwise usable, Petya overwrites your computer's boot sector^([1]) and makes it point to a special operating system that performs the file encryption. 

The current Petya campaign, centered in the Ukraine but not confined there, is basically an unholy hybrid of Petya and WannaCry. [It spreads to computers using an infected Office document,](https://imgur.com/a/fFGVL) and once it's on there it attempts to spread itself to other computers using both MS17-010 (the WannaCry exploit developed by the NSA) and system tools like PsExec and WMI^([2]) that allow users to run commands on remote systems. How does it do that? It checks to see if there are any administrator credentials cached on your machine and uses them to authenticate on other computers if there are. It's a clever approach: infect the unpatched machines, then get the passwords and use them to infect the patched machines. 

tl;dr [it's bad. it's really, really bad](https://twitter.com/TedOnPrivacy/status/879721978051141632)

# How are people getting infected?

I will be updating this section as I learn more.

Right now, it appears that Petya utilizes ~~two~~ one patched bug~~s~~, ~~[CVE-2017-0199](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler.html) and~~ [MS17-010](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx), to spread itself. Make sure your machines are patched against these.

**Initially, Petya gets onto a computer through an infected Microsoft Office or Wordpad document**. This can be sent to you through a variety of methods, though I suspect in most cases it will be via a malicious email (a very common attack vector). If the file is opened, it will download a copy of the virus onto your computer and run it. **Once a machine is infected, it will use [a known SMB v1 bug](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx) to infect other computers.** This exploit, codenamed MS17-010, [is the same exploit that was used in the WannaCry campaign conducted last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6atu62/psa_massive_ransomware_campaign_wcry_is_currently/). If it can reach a vulnerable computer, it will use a bug in the SMB v1 implementation to infect the remote machine. It can do this without permission, which you might be able to tell is a huge issue. 

While I don’t have the full details involving this yet, **Petya also appears to look for cached network credentials to infect machines via WMI**^([2]). This means that even if you are fully patched against MS17-010, you still run the risk of getting infected. Reduce your attack surface as much as possible.

**EDIT** - [Looks like a vaccine for the WMI/PsExec attack vector has been found.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vaccine-not-killswitch-found-for-petya-notpetya-ransomware-outbreak/) 

# What can I do?

If you've been infected, I'm sorry, but as of now there's no known file recovery method. You will have to either restore from backup (you do have backups, right?) or reformat your PC.

If your computer has crashed with a blue screen, ***under no circumstances should you allow Windows to reboot.*** Petya begins encrypting your files after it restarts, which renders them impossible to recover (as of this writing). Instead, use a Linux live CD or USB and back up your personal data, or clone the hard drive for later data recovery. 

**If you have not yet been infected, patch your machines.** It won't eliminate the possibility of getting infected, but it'll reduce the attack surface that the virus can exploit.

Here are the patches you need to install, if you haven’t already:

### WMI/PsExec 

It appears that the encryption routine for this won't run if a certain file (`C:\Windows\perfc`) exists and is marked as read only. [You can create such a file by performing the following steps:](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vaccine-not-killswitch-found-for-petya-notpetya-ransomware-outbreak/)

1. Open up an administrative Command Prompt. For Windows XP to 7 users, do this by opening the Start Menu, going to All Programs -> Accessories, right clicking on `Command Prompt`, and selecting `Run as Administrator`. Windows 8 and up users can right click on the Start Button and select ""Command Prompt (Admin)"" or ""Powershell (Admin)."" 
2. Run the following: 

        echo Petya/NotPetya vaccination file > C:\Windows\perfc
        echo Petya/NotPetya vaccination file > C:\Windows\perfc.dat
        echo Petya/NotPetya vaccination file > C:\Windows\perfc.dll

3. After that, run the following: 

        attrib +R C:\Windows\perfc
        attrib +R C:\Windows\perfc.dat
        attrib +R C:\Windows\perfc.dll

Once that's done, you should be safe from the WMI/PsExec attack vector. [Here's what the end result should look like.](https://i.imgur.com/jOPjYvk.png)

Stay safe, everyone.

A British security researcher using the Twitter handle MalwareTech accidentally slowed the spread of the ransomware over the weekend by registering a domain name discovered in the ransomware's code. 

One thing that is very important to note is our sinkholing only stops this sample and there is nothing stopping them removing the domain check and trying again, so it's incredibly important that any unpatched systems are patched as quickly as possible,"" MalwareTech says.

From Wikipedia:

Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system so that it is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion. It encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as paysafecard or Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult.

Thanks to the way Microsoft issues patches, there are quite a few KBs to look for... So we wanted to share some technical details to help you determine if your endpoints are protected from this ransomware:

* [Automate KB for new Patch Manager](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Automate/ConnectWise_Automate_Knowledge_Base_Articles/MS17-010_or_WannaCry_-_New_Patch_Manager)
* [Automate KB for legacy Patch Manager](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Automate/ConnectWise_Automate_Knowledge_Base_Articles/MS17-010_or_WannaCry_-_Legacy_Patching_and_all_versions_prior_to_Automate_11)

**Bonus 1**: If you're using [Webroot, you're already protected](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2017/05/13/wannacry-ransomware-webroot/).

**Bonus 2**: Here's a list of the KB for MSPs that aren't using ConnectWise Automate (formerly LabTech):

* KB4019264 - For Windows 7 SP1 / Windows 2008 R2 SP1
* KB4019215 - For Windows 8.1 / Windows 2012 R2 Standard
* KB4019216 - For Windows 2012 Standard
* KB4019472 - For Windows 10 (1607) / Windows 2016
* KB4012598 - For out of date OS - Windows XP/Vista/8/2003
* KB4013198 - For out of date Windows 10 (511)

If you really want to go the extra mile tho, start disabling SMB v1 where possible, as it was used in ~30% of the exploits released by ShadowBrokers last month.

Here is the odd part, it was becoming very slow, despite more than capable hardware so it was just reimaged last week. My primary PC upgraded to Windows 10, however, my VPN operates on Windows 7. In any event, I don't think I've been to a single not intranet website on my VPN, from the beginning none of my office files transferred (perhaps because of wannacry?) on my vpn, and after looking up Wannacry I do know that a computer can become infected by another infected computer within the network, so it is not a requirement for to have done anything to acquire this. Is it possible my original problems had something to do with it / this? Does anyone know if reimaging is just as good a fix as getting a new pc? I'm not a moron when it comes to pcs, but I'm no expert. I don't want to argue with IT either and pretend I know more than them or whatever. I don't know, its just this gut feeling that I didn't just so happen to randomly acquire this during the past week. Maybe the image they used was corrupted? Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Now that I'm home having a metered and a weak Internet connection, It's difficult for me to receive updates. I use my laptop solely to visit secure websites (Google, YouTube, Reddit etc.) I don't use email to on this laptop and I'm very careful with unknown links and websites. With all this in mind, I have a few questions:

1. Is my laptop still vulnerable to WannaCry?
2. Is it true that WannaCry infects (unpatched/not updated) PCs without any triggers or reasons?",1,1.0,1495469257,2
601,6bhq1g,Bitcoin,Effect of WannaCry on Bitcoin,"The WannaCry attack could burst the bitcoin bubble. Governments around the world could respond to the recent ransomware attack by attempting to shut down bitcoin.

Bitcoin not only makes a large scale ransomware computer attack relativity easy and secure, but it makes other kinds of ransom much easier to perpetrate. Kidnap a family member of a wealthy person and demand payment in bitcoin. People have warned about this use of bitcoin from the beginning, and indeed I have been told that many previous ransoms have succeeded by demanded bitcoin payment. It makes it far more difficult to catch the kidnapper.

Probably most (99%?) of the people who received the ransomware attack had no idea how to obtain a bitcoin. My guess is that most of those attacked immediately decided to pay, and planned that once their system was restored, to upgrade it or put in the protection. But how to pay in bitcoin? To do this they had to contact a broker, someone who advertises bitcoin conversion for a fee.

I’m predicting that many governments around the world will try to make bitcoin exchanges illegal in order to make it very difficult to change dollars into bitcoins. There will always be back-doors (exchange in Nigeria or some other location that will keep them legal) but the governments can make convenient exchanges much more difficult.

Why would they do this? Part of the reason is that this attack takes much of the luster off bitcoin. More importantly, the government likely will not find the criminals responsible, and that makes them lose face. Typical government approach to a disaster: make sure it doesn’t happen again. And they pass laws without due consideration of side effects.

To the extent that you can exchange bitcoins for goods, their value is independent of exchange into hard currency. Bitcoin can’t be outlawed any more than barter can be outlawed. But the net effect would be to turn bitcoin into a “soft currency”, and that would degrade its value. It will be interesting to watch the value of bitcoin over the next few weeks. People may withdraw from it as they realize that it may be a target of government. In the first few days, the value of bitcoin has already dropped 10%; see the link: Bitcoin plunges $200 after cyber attackers demand ransom using the digital currency. The crash of 1929 began with such relatively small drops, but they kept up, day after day. The bitcoin bubble might be bursting already.

Outlawing bitcoin exchanges could lead to an even greater disaster: huge computer files around the world lost, as the ransom perpetrators are willing to destroy a great deal in order to get payment from a few.

It is not clear whether Microsoft will benefit or suffer from this event. My guess is that most of the affected systems in China and Russia were illegal copies of their operating systems. (Despite this, I do not suspect that Microsoft was behind the attack!) Of course, Microsoft also loses because their systems are still more vulnerable to this kind of attack than are others.

Expect to see advertisements in the future for backup systems that are invulnerable to worms even if they are on the same local network. These might include backup systems that remain disconnected unless they can verify that the operating system they are backing up can pass some tests.

Did this worm begin at the NSA? That’s the rumor that is spread, and it is getting a lot of traction because the NSA refuses to comment. That is, of course, their standard policy: don’t confirm or deny. The world should not take their refusal as confirmation.

704,6b3jo4,wannacry,MEGA: How to prevent being attacked by Wanna cry/mitigate its damage,"Wanna cry may have been stopped for now, but there **will be** the second wave that we must prepare for.


Let's start with the Basics

1stly, if you're using windows 7/8/10 **Update windows!!**, Microsoft [released a patch](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4013389/title) fixing the wanna cry vulnerability 2 months ago!

Also [**BACKUP YOUR FILES!!!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFO6NyLIP7M), **OFFLINE** and disconnected from your computer!

If you are using Windows XP, either update the computer or take it offline **now!**

This is basic computer security but I'm shocked at a number of people whom sadly did not seem to practice this.

Please post any more suggestions below.

If you have been attacked already, then I'm sorry, but there's very little anyone can do for you, and **do not pay the ransom**, because you will not get your data back if you have.

705,6snlsu,sysadmin,PtH makes me WannaCry,"I've been reading through the MS advice on mitigating PtH and their first and primary suggestion is to have separate accounts for workstation admins, server admins, and domain controller admins. 

I am a team of 1 actual IT guy and my boss who is technically in IT but doesn't know anything about IT and 1 other person who can reset AD users passwords. Right now my boss and I are domain admins and logon with those credentials for everyday use. The person who does password resets is a standard user with local admin privileges (so she can open RSAT) who has delegated permissions for password resets. 

So let me get this straight, in an ideal situation... 
1) My boss and I should have 4 separate accounts?! 1 standard, 1 workstation admin, 1 server admin, and 1 domain admin account. 
2) The password admin should have 2 accounts, 1 password admin and 1 standard user? 
3) We are supposed to restrict logons to the machine that has the role, so server admin account can only logon to fileservers/appserver and domain admin account can only log onto domain controllers?

So barring the fact that I am some how supposed to remember 4 separate AD account passwords, how many workstations do I need to do my job? If I'm supposed to be logging into my primary workstation with my standard user account to do things like read email how am I supposed to add a new user or change a group policy? My DC's are server core installations and I was managing things through RSAT on my local workstation but now am I supposed to RDP to a jump server and then manage users through that? What about the password administrator, is she supposed to do the same to a completely different workstation to reset passwords? What about changing folder permissions, can I RDP to the file servers with the server account permissions without exposing the server admins credentials?

I can tell you if it requires all PS administration I would actually not mind it so much but my boss will never figure it out. I would love to hear an eloquent solution to the problem or have someone tell me that I'm over thinking things. Please help me...",7,0.74,1502304547,2

750,6atgj0,newzealand,"PSA: If you haven't updated your Windows computers in the past month, do it now - ransomware worm (a virus) is spreading globally","This has happened overnight for our timezone so we're lucky, but there's currently a ransomware worm being spread globally.

[Ars Technica Article](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/05/an-nsa-derived-ransomware-worm-is-shutting-down-computers-worldwide/)

[BBC News Article](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39896393)

[The Guardian Article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/12/nhs-ransomware-cyber-attack-what-is-wanacrypt0r-20)

'WannaCry', 'WCry' or 'WCrypt' is the name of a worm (type of computer virus) which is using a vulnerability in windows (Microsoft Reference [MS17-010](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx)) which was patched by Microsoft last month. It uses this to spread automatically across the internet and across company intranets, as well as via email.

But turns out people and businesses are slow at running updates, or simply don't update at all (eg running XP). Two notable entities that have been infected are the UK National Health Service, who is currrently in a crisis as a result, and Fedex. No doubt there will be more infected and revealed over the coming days.

[This is only an estimate, but this many networks around the world are believed to be infected](https://intel.malwaretech.com/botnet/wcrypt) 


**For Home Users**: If you run XP, not much can help you if you open this malware. Or many of the other exploits that XP is vulnerable to. Stop running XP, move to Windows 10, or if that isn't feasible, 7 or 8.1.

If you run a more modern windows system, these are still vulnerable, but if you have run windows update in the past month and rebooted, you are likely ok. Yes believe it or not those annoying updates are actually for a reason, and are arguably more important than an antivirus in many cases. But always be vigilant when opening suspicious emails with attachments.

**For IT Admins**: If you run XP, you have bigger problems with your IT strategy than just this one outbreak. But there are mitigations such as powering off non essential systems to reduce the risk, and ensuring windows firewall is blocking Windows file sharing (SMB port 445) especially from unessential sources.

If you run a more modern windows system, if you have run windows update in the past month across your fleet and rebooted them, you are likely ok. Patches should be have already been applied in the past month from Windows Update, WSUS, SCCM - whatever tool you use. But if they haven't, you may want to spend some time this weekend checking them and compliance levels if you have that metric.

This isn't a complex attack - its using a publicly known vulnerability that has had fixes available for a month, and the concept of ransomware has been around for many years. It's mostly exploiting peoples poor practices.",143,0.95,1494617463,2

I had this crazy idea today that the surge in bitcoin could actually be linked to the recent WannaCry ransomware hack.  Hear me out, [according to eyerys]

That's $69 000 000 - $138 000 000.  

Now I know not everything has been paid, but even if a small fraction was paid it would still have a big impact.

so i (14f) recently got diagnosed with atypical anorexia. i won't get into numbers but i was never underweight at any point and i was at my pre-ed weight when i was diagnosed. i also b/p hence why i never really lost much weight.

when i was starving my body was really malnourished. i had constant chest pains and felt dizzy all the time. i was also servely dehydrated. now i need to eat a lot and drink a lot of water everyday to make sure my body recovers.
i know logically that getting help is a good thing but i don't like it. i don't like gaining weight even though ik that it's be i malnourished my body for so long. im so mad that i even got to this in the first place. im just now realizing how pretty i was pre-ed.

i feel so stupid for even feeling sad because i have an amazing home life, supportive parents and amazing friends at school. my parents have been helping me eat more but i keep lashing out and getting upset with them and i feel so guilty bc they're literally the kindest people ever and all they want to do is help me get healthier.
i'm healing physically but my mental health is only getting worse. i cried 5 times today in school becuase of my weight and eating and my friends are starting to catch on. i really don't wanna tell them (they'd all be supportive but it's just so damn awkward).

i keep thinking abt what would've happened if i 
hadnt developed this horrible illness. i wouldn't wish this upon anyone. it's so dumb because this is literally the only bad thing in my life but it’s so difficult. i know i need to eat but i hate it. i hate gaining weight, i’m so scared of food and i’m starting to dislike even my favorite foods. it’s so pathetic and i don’t even know how to express my feelings without sounding dramatic or attention seeking.

and the worst part is that i’m losing my personality. i used to love reading but i haven’t opened in a book in forever. i also liked walking but i can’t do that bc of this whole recovery thing. i’ve tried to distract myself w movies and shows but it doesn’t work. my days consist of sleeping, crying and doing homework at school and then coming home and mindlessly scrolling through social media till like 2 am to stop thinking about this whole situation and prevent myself from crying more (which i always end up doing anyways). and ofc eating and feeling bloated all the time.

idk i’m just regretting this whole thing. ed’s fucking suck. i don’t know how i’m going to feel better. i don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel. i just wanna go back, i don’t wanna deal with this.",1,1.0,1706719750,2

Is there any function to do that or did they a fully reverse of the function and then code it?

Can you give me some tips about how do you usually start an analysis with IDA?

Example: the first image of https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/05/the-worm-that-spreads-wanacrypt0r/ with the domain in a comment.

https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/business/analysis-wannacry-ransomware-outbreak/

But the only way it gets in is though email i assume, but the question is as the ransomware is using the exploit of the MS17-010 does that mean any user can have admin privileges? Last time i tested ransomware on my lab it only infects file shares if the user have permissions.

User 1---permission---folder 1 

user 2 ---permission---folder 1 and folder 2

User 1 gets infected and infects folder 1 but NOT folder 2

Or am i wrong?

- You catch this virus just like any other virus on the internet

- The only thing that sets this one apart from other viruses is the way it spreads to other machines

- The patch from Microsoft only prevents it from spreading from  one machine to another (i.e you can still catch this after patching by the first point)

If your PC has been infected by WannaCry – the ransomware that wreaked havoc across the world last Friday – you might be lucky to get your locked files back without paying the ransom of $300 to the cyber criminals.

Adrien Guinet, a French security researcher from Quarkslab, has discovered a way to retrieve the secret encryption keys used by the WannaCry Ransomware for free, which works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and 2008 operating systems.

WannaCry Ransomware Decryption Keys

The WannaCry's encryption scheme works by generating a pair of keys on the victim's computer that rely on prime numbers, a ""public"" key and a ""private"" key for encrypting and decrypting the system’s files respectively.

To prevent the victim from accessing the private key and decrypting locked files himself, Wanna Cry erases the key from the system, leaving no choice for the victims to retrieve the decryption key except paying the ransom to the attacker.

But here's the kicker: WannaCry ""does not erase the prime numbers from memory before freeing the associated memory,"" says Guinet.

Based on this finding, Guinet released a WannaCry ransomware decryption tool, named
, that basically tries to retrieve the two prime numbers, used in the formula to generate encryption keys from memory.

Orion is installed across thousands of companies, state and local governments, U.S. Government agencies, and the Department of Defense. The Department of Homeland Security took the rare step of issuing an Emergency Directive, ordering all Government agencies to shut down Orion, conduct forensics, reimage, and hunt for hackers. This has caused massive disruption for many companies IT departments across the world.

Fortunately (if there's a way to think about it), the hackers appear to only have used their malware to gain command and control of the server. From there, they pivoted off to steal information, conduct other hacks, and do naughty things (see the U.S. Treasury being hacked...).

Why should this be (another) wake up call for us? Had this not been C&C software, but rather a zero-day ransomware, we'd be in much deeper doo-doo right now. Imagine 18000+ companies and government agencies in the U.S. alone going down all at once to some extent as ransomware hit them. Logistics, stores, hospitals, government agencies, airports... they could have all been affected.

They gained access to victims via trojanized updates to SolarWind’s Orion IT monitoring and management software. This campaign may have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is currently ongoing. Post compromise activity following this supply chain compromise has included lateral movement and data theft. The campaign is the work of a highly skilled actor and the operation was conducted with significant operational security.

Last time I released a documentary on the WannaCry video and since it was received really well by this sub - I just wanted to let you guys know about my new documentary on the [SolarWinds hack.](https://youtu.be/Kf7Motm36Go)

I know it's still under investigation, so in hindsight - maybe not the best topic - but I found it super interesting so I decided to cover everything known so far.

The hardest part was probably trying to make it understandable even to laypersons - specially while explaining the technical stuff. I had to simplify it by a lot, but I'll be pasting all my references into a pastebin page hopefully by tomorrow so if anyone wants to really look into the way the backdoor worked in detail - you can check that out!

It's an incredibly interesting hack - so I definitely recommend it!

The reason [my last video](https://youtu.be/PKHH_gvJ_hA) got any traction at all was mostly because of this sub and r/hacking \- so thank you so much for the support!. I would love to get feedback on this so I can keep improving, so feel free to let me know.

Recap of what happened previously:  
\-SolarWinds stock crashed over the past 6 days non-stop.  
\-SolarWinds software was used to attack 18,000 very, very big name customers (you've already read the news). More and more bad news is coming in, and 18,000 is only what has been found in the initial investigation.  
\-Instead of doing something about the news, management may have traded on insider information and sold their stock. Oh, and their CEO ""just happened to leave"" too.  
\-Lots of incompetence shown throughout. For example, using password of ""solarwinds123"" for their critical server.

Every day some people thought it was the dip and they could buy it. Nope, it will crash again this Monday.

Let's take a look at what's new over the weekend:  
\-SolarWinds is freaking out every government agency in the world, including in the US.  
\-SolarWinds is freaking out every financial institution because they got hacked too  
\-SolarWinds is freaking out basically every large organization in the world  
\-A large bulk of SolarWinds revenue comes from the US government. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) asked every government agency in the US to remove this bad SolarWinds software. This might become legally binding so that they can make a scapegoat out of SolarWinds.  
\-The management has basically said nothing on this, even days after this was reported.  
\-US politicians are calling the SolarWinds attack an act of war. If you want to know the last time this happened...well, never.  
\-Nobody has a freaking clue of what's the extent of this as every day there are more and more findings every hour.  
\-To let you understand the scale of this, every single cyber security organization is working on this because their customers got hacked. Every single government in the world is checking to see what secrets have been stolen. Every single news agency is rushing to report this, and likely already did. Every single large organization (you know someone) is working on checking this and figuring out how to remove SolarWinds software from their organization.  
\-SolarWinds is going to get sued to the ground by their customers and partners, not only for this hack but for their non-response. Oh and their customers are going to say goodbye too.  
\-Think some customers and partners will stick with SolarWinds? Maybe. But they can't, because Microsoft (which controls your computer) is forcing the removal of SolarWinds software regardless.

\-How bad is the SolarWinds hack? It's been called the ""Hack of The Decade"". The bad news ain't going away after one week.

You want to see how bad this is?

\-Every government (and organization) is freaked out

# What Was The SolarWinds Hack?

SolarWinds is a major US information technology company who services cybersecurity for many Fortune 500 companies as well as multiple agencies in the US government.

Earlier in 2020, intruders which were most likely funded, nation-state hackers who installed malicious code into the company’s “Orion” system which is used by their 33,000 customers’ IT companies.

During a software update, SolarWind’s already compromised Orion software had sent out a software-update which infected their customers’ systems and created a backdoor in up to 18,000 of the customers who installed the update.

US agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury were attacked. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations like the California Department of State Hospitals, and Kent State University, the Wall Street Journal reported. [https://www.businessinsider.com/solarwinds-hack-explained-government-agencies-cyber-security-2020-12](https://www.businessinsider.com/solarwinds-hack-explained-government-agencies-cyber-security-2020-12)   


# What Does It Have To Do With Nashville?

I believe the SolarWinds hack was just the beginning.

Of what?

I'm not certain, but I do know that the US announced that the main purpose of the SolarWinds Hack was to steal information from various departments – one of which was the Department Of Energy.

I think whatever CCP or Anti-Western Nation-state stole was the last link to what they needed to complete their **SUNSTORM** virus and **STINGRAY** device.

I’ll go over more detail about the **SUNSTORM** virus later, but this document is where it is mentioned. If the document is authentic, it was leaked by the S McG channel. The S McG channel will be mentioned later in detail as well.

By the way, did you notice how quickly this story was dropped by all media outlets? It didn’t last more than a week. Seems to be a lot of that going on lately.

The FBI had their story – lone bomber warns people to evacuate the area for 45 minutes because there is a bomb that is about to go off. He commits suicide by shooting himself; the bomb blows up with only the single casualty – the bomber. He was a conspiracy theorist and believes extraterrestrial life exists so that’s why he did it. The bomb was the cause of the power outages – case closed.

The media made us believe that he killed himself with those 3 shots just prior to the countdown announcement. **Who TF kills themselves with 3 bullets?**

We'll never know because the bomb blew it all of the evidence.

I think the Nashville bombing was just a decoy. I’m certain that Anthony Warner was already murdered well before the explosion went off.  


[Aftermath of the Nashville Bombing](https://preview.redd.it/26h2kavnrma61.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8126be1ea546242a5826f9af670b91e52bc49503)

# Loud Booms Before The Gunshots And RV Explosion

Someone posted on Reddit that they were renting an AirBnB with their family for the holiday season. Both OP, OP’s brother (or sister – I don’t remember) and OP’s mom were all woken up between 1am and 3am from a loud “BOOM” that shook their beds that they were sleeping on. (I can’t remember what subreddit that post was written on but it was definitely posted on December 25th. Please post if you find it.)

OP claimed that they all went back to sleep but were absolutely startled.

From my memory, they woke up again to the sound of gunshots which alerted them to go to the windows. Only then did they start hearing the faint and eerie, pre-recorded voice stating that a bomb would explode soon.

I’m not sure how far OP was from the explosion, but from what I remember from the post, OP was inside of the AirBnB when the bomb went off. The windows shattered and OP had to go to the hospital due to something falling on them – I believe the frame of a window… or something like that.

OP was not seriously injured but was most likely one of the “3 people that were injured but no deaths” as some of us recall in the earliest news updates on Christmas Day.

The key point to take away from this was that there was a smaller “Boom” or “Bang” hours before the actual explosion went off. I remember that someone in the comments section said it was most likely a dump-truck picking up a dumpster and that inner-city dump-truck drivers operate at all times of the night.

I guess it seems plausible, and I can also attest that they are extremely loud. But, on the other hand, was the multiple “Booms” that shook their building a breach of some sort into the AT&T building? The RV was parked right next to it warning everyone to remain clear of the area due to a bomb that was about to explode.  


# AT&T Break-In Theory

A group affiliated with the CCP broke into that AT&T call center and installed the SUNSTORM virus to test its capabilities.

They programed it to execute just prior to the bomb exploding. The gunshots allowed the police to get alerted and arrive on scene. Also, the gunshots prevented people in their Airbnb’s above to not film the streets due to possibly getting shot at. The countdown prevented police and anyone else from getting too close to investigate the break-in at the AT&T building.

The virus executes a few minutes prior to the bomb going off or was executed but had a built in delay to start its process just prior to the bomb going off.

The bomb goes off and the **Blackout** starts. All 911 services, cell, landline, internet is down for days within hundreds of miles.

The **SUNSTORM** virus ""test"" was a success.

They didn't kill any innocent people which would have created a much bigger investigation and it gave the media an excuse to drop the story.  


# Who Is S McG?

Following the Nashville Bombing, a YouTube video of surveillance footage of the bombing was released by a channel called “S McG”. Here’s the video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nygTJeu9fU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nygTJeu9fU) 

https://preview.redd.it/cb5jwmturma61.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=a422dd13c4d035577e27a1d05cb28741e62503a9

The internet conspiracy theorists went wild because that channel was created back in 2014 and has never before uploaded any videos.

I don’t think there’s much to this because I believe this person is associated with the owner of Studio 154.

[https://imgur.com/a/cXDG7Y0](https://imgur.com/a/cXDG7Y0) 

The footage came from this security camera located above Studio 154:

# A New Cryptic S McG Channel Emerges

The New S McG YouTube channel started releasing cryptic videos from December 26th until its last video on January 6th then a few hours later they deleted their channel altogether.

[Coalition of the North American Socialist Republic \(CNASR\) flag](https://preview.redd.it/6g4qrms7sma61.png?width=222&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e97feac7197b268699a49662aecbbf52b123a5)

Most of the videos either contained Pastebin links that lead to Tor links or the video titles themselves contained the links.

    If you want to skip to see the screenshots of all the Pastebin and Tor files, check the sub-heading at the bottom of this post.

This channel is no longer up, but someone following the channel has been making copies of each one of the videos. This backup channel is missing “1995\_\_CARAVAN” and “11.2.20-Gohstie” videos. It also contains 3 extra videos that weren’t featured on the S McG channel: “1.1.2hammergo (REVERSE) and 6JAN\_CARAVAN\_PLN (REVERSE) to see if there was any message in the only 2 videos that featured English speakers. The third video that was added appears to be some kind of military craft titled “ELCTRC\_RN\_OR\_COMS (3261A)” which was uncovered from one of the Tor links.

This post also referenced this other post as well:

According to OP, the original video was uploaded on December 20th, but while the S McG channel was still up, it said the channel was created on December 26th a day after the Nashville Bombing. Take a look at the comment section. You’ll find a bunch of comments that were edited.

Here’s the S McG channel that was deleted; feel free to load it in the Way Back Machine: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEfBgwxufdnLOtc1P3RehOg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEfBgwxufdnLOtc1P3RehOg) 

If you want to skip to screenshots of all the files that were released, go to the **“PASTEBIN / TOR LINKS:”** section.

The following sub-headings are the title with the links of each video that was released on the S McG channel in order.  


# 1.1.2_hammer_go

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vafiV7aCLZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vafiV7aCLZM) 

The clip is from the YT video “LEWIS IS DEAD - BRUCE WAYNE / FERRARI MODULO” uploaded on Feb 15, 2015. It also features an image of “CAMCORDER TRUTH JIHAD” at the end of the video. This is the link to the original artist from the clip:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycLybdG1BZg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycLybdG1BZg) 

The lyrics basically state that he has a million dollar bounty on his head and why did I bring you (us – the people going down the S McG rabbit-hole) along.

“lewis is dead” is one of the tags on almost every video on this channel. Lewis Is Dead also appears to be one of the featured artists in the songs on this channel. This is Lewis Is Dead’s channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy985j8UjOWD2j9lwnw4\_OA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy985j8UjOWD2j9lwnw4_OA) 

The channel “TRIBE” also has the following videos with the tag “new jersey” in the YouTube video page meta:

* “LEWIS IS DEAD – BLACK AUTUMN 1993 \[FULL ALBUM STREAM\]”
* “LIONMMVIII (ALLEN WOLF & BEAMON) - BY THE GODS \[FULL ALBUM\]”
* “LIONMMVIII (LEWIS IS DEAD + BEAMON) - I DON'T LIKE (CHIEF KEEF REMIX) (2012)”

The song “LEWIS – ON A PALE HORSE (2012) has channel tags “anthony, oppenheimer, dark, july, 4th, ameri”

According to [https://imgur.com/a/1A5YcAg](https://imgur.com/a/1A5YcAg) there is talk about summer which possibly means something happening on July 4, 2021…? According to the Book of Revelation, the fourth horseman rides a pale horse and is identified as Death.  


# 3s.VOD

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQj4zJ9CTsc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQj4zJ9CTsc) 

No data to extract from this video except that there are 3 colors shown across the entire screen – Black, Red, White, and Blue. This could possibly be symbolism of the US going dark.  


# 1995__CARAVAN

Video: NONE

No idea what this video was about. I was never able to watch this, but sources have told me that this video looked like it was filmed on the side of an RV – possibly the RV used in the Nashville Bombing?

Notice in the following link that the channel used be called “G McS”. This is what Google saved as cache:

# 11.2.20-Gohstie

Video: NONE

I was never able to actually watch this video since it was deleted before I even heard of this S McG rabbit hole. The link in 1995\_\_CARAVAN shows the Google Cache.

A quick Google search will bring you to The Daily Zeitgeist Podcast **“Election Countdown, Ghost Dads 11.2.20”** on November 2, 2020 they are located in Los Angeles:

[https://www.amazon.com/Election-Countdown-Ghost-Dads-11-2-20/dp/B08KYY557C](https://www.amazon.com/Election-Countdown-Ghost-Dads-11-2-20/dp/B08KYY557C) 

The Amazon description reads: ""FOOTNOTES: Lil Wayne, Brett Favre & More Stars Endorse Donald Trump For President In 2020 Election. Why Pennsylvania’s Vote Count Could Change After Election Night.""

I didn’t listen to the entire podcast, but I was able to transcribe a couple minutes about 8 or 9 minutes into their show. The following ONLY had 2 male voices speaking about the Covid-19 situation in LA at the time:

""1 in 4 people have the disease. At that time ambulance operators are instructed not to transport patients that they do not believe will survive the hospital. Hospitals are adding freezers but not the bodies to store the vaccine. Most of the physicians that I know who work in the emergency rooms are being taken off of non-covid related cases to focus only on Covid cases.""

""Yeah we're in that place. Darkness has descended on the city. It's the Wuhan we saw when the outbreak first happened in China. It's inexcusable that it's a slow-motion 'We saw that. It was reported on. We knew what had to be done and to avoid that'. I think the main thing that we learned is how just inexcusably indifferent to the death and suffering of its own people America is as a culture.""

So something strange happened; when I went back to the link the following day January 8, the podcast I listened to the night before was not the same one. This time there were 2 males and 1 female talking. They were very upbeat and not depressed sounding like the original one talking about Covid-19 spreading throughout LA.

They were talking about the storming of the Capitol.

So the podcast “Election Countdown, Ghost Dads 11.2.20” was replaced with “This IS America, White Supremacy Doorbuster 1.8.21”. Very strange.

This will hopefully give you a better visual on what happened:

Also, if you install the free Keepa extension, it will prove that the current podcast on the “Election Countdown, Ghost Dads 11.2.20” was modified and re-uploaded on January 8th. Check out this visual:

# 6JAN_CARAVAN_PLN

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWQ1c9tY4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWQ1c9tY4) 

The start of this video shows a Vizio computer model VA19LHDTV10T 19” 720p HD LCD monitor playing a show called “Airplanes & Airports”.

It then jumps to a clip of a Penglai worker at one of the factories in China assembling the foundation to one of the machines they market.

The video then shows an image of a delivery truck in China with a giant CNASR vinyl sticker attached to the side approximately 8ft by 10ft which are not the correct dimensions of the US flag. The flag shown appears to be the US flag but instead of the blue background with the 50 white stars, there is a Chinese Communist red background with the yellow Hammer and sickle with the white star. Below the image there is Chinese writing that translates to: **“DON’T BE NEAR THE RED LAKE HOUSE”**.

The next screen is in Chinese. It says: **“DEPOSITE $45 USD TO THE FOLLOWING BTC ADDRESS. ON THE SERVER THERE WILL BE A 1.2GB VIDEO FILE”**  


# RQ_HIT_SOLAR.avi

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsMjS18hCVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsMjS18hCVE) 

This video is taken from someone standing on the balcony of a 3 or 4 story building near 3 tall antenna towers. In the background several miles away, there appears to be an explosion caused by an aircraft that possibly fired a missile.

Several have thought that this was someone filming the explosion at Nashville from a distance but this is unlikely because the explosion happened when the sun was still down – unlike this video.

The final scene is a QR code with Chinese that translates to: **“THE FOLLOWING UPLOAD HAS BEEN PAID FOR BY OTHER CUSTOMERS”**. Another pastebin link appears  


# http://torpastephp3x73w.onion/wuvxzkjI/

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftn4Ay9FXxI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftn4Ay9FXxI) 

This video shows a clip of what appears to be a Chinook but the Aft end of it looks like a different craft. There is Chinese writing that translates to: “UNITY AND PEACEFUL COMMUNITY TWO SCHOOLS INTO ONE”. It’s followed by someone taking macro video footage of a picture of a distant mushroom cloud explosion.

The video shows a sequence of black / red / black / red screens then shows the pastebin link: [https://imgur.com/a/7fgl6z4](https://imgur.com/a/7fgl6z4) 

It lead to this: [https://imgur.com/a/PXVm04s](https://imgur.com/a/PXVm04s) 

I found this guy Hanan Assayag from the Penglai Industrial website: [https://www.penglaichina.com/contact.html](https://www.penglaichina.com/contact.html) 

He is the US contact for their company located in Florida which raised some questions.

I found that website because the clip of the worker on the older video 6JAN\_CARAVAN\_PLN shows their phone number at the bottom. It's a clip of one of their YouTube videos of one of the workers building a foundation for one of their machines that Penglai sells. I can't find the video because between all of their YT channels/vids, they have thousands of vids.

This Hanan guy has all these LLC's registered to him in Florida and one is not ""technically"" registered to him but it's registered to an umbrella corp that he owns. Follow the link and you will notice Hanan Assayag owns 9 businesses registered in Florida.

[http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResults/OfficerRegisteredAgentName/Assayag%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Hanan/Page1](http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResults/OfficerRegisteredAgentName/Assayag%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Hanan/Page1) 

He lives in Florida but YUKON RIVER LLC that he owns is located at 675 THIRD AVENUE FLOOR 26, NEW YORK, NY 10017 which is located on the same squared block as one of Pfizer's main offices. It's only a few buildings away... basically a few minute walk

# pw: jsjxw2015

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUQy-Gjtfew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUQy-Gjtfew) 

This video shows a sequence of frames of Black Screen, Camera, and Red/Black Screen. I’m not too sure what it means, but it does seem like they are spaced out in length of frames and sequence to create some kind of code that I was not able to figure out. Here’s the link to an analysis of the beginning of the video: [https://imgur.com/a/MsOQxzI](https://imgur.com/a/MsOQxzI) 

There is also a pastebin link that takes you to this website: [https://imgur.com/a/Gl1Lytk](https://imgur.com/a/Gl1Lytk) . The pastebin mentions 754791756qq which is listed on that site as a dot com. This is what it used to look like when you follow that link: [https://imgur.com/a/pS9Wi8g](https://imgur.com/a/pS9Wi8g) and the password was obviously the title of the YT video.

The pdf is this: [https://imgur.com/a/NoCPFHY](https://imgur.com/a/NoCPFHY) 

https://preview.redd.it/h43eazfhtma61.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=e640a28b06f8d780583fe6da18a99339d53f492e

At the time this was the worst PDF that was dropped. It is basically a “Welcome On Board!” for Chinese spies working in the US within a group called the Coalition of the North American Socials Republic.

It speaks of imminent communications disruptions and food shortages in the United States which they are saying that is vital to rebuilding America after “the collapse”.

This word document was also located on the site that the video pointed to this word document. Keep in mind that the original word document was in Chinese. This was created after being translated to English:

“List of Advanced Individuals of Advanced Collectives in Economic and Social Development of Jieshou City in 2019.docx”

# NC_map_color_phase_soon

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBAj0RWGvOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBAj0RWGvOM) 

\*Be Sure To Turn On The Subtitles!

This video basically is Chinese Communist Party propaganda talking about the fall of the United States and how it will be dependent on China for its economy to survive.

It claims that 50% of Americans will be infected with the new coronavirus. The word “new” could be a misinterpretation for “novel”.

Then goes on to say how China has surpassed the US economy in March 2020 and that most people in the US will continue to be surrounded by this virus because the US did not take the epidemic prevention seriously.

The video goes on to state how dependent the US is on Made in China products especially regarding the pandemic such as: masks, ventilators, gloves, goggles, etc.  


# Comp_br005_cold

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQGmTHv0u70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQGmTHv0u70) 

This video shows a small server about 2 stacks. It pans to the right which shows a camera tripod but does not show the camera that is possibly recording the user’s actions. On top of the server is a device with 4 antenna coming out of it with a laptop and 2 cell phones above it.

Could this possibly be an IMSI catcher?  


# http://torpastephp3x73w.onion/emlFSC5A/

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-PWEd2DiKk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-PWEd2DiKk) 

The video showed someone driving up to the back of an RV with a white Communist Hammer and Sickle sticker on the back of it. They arrived to the RV at 5:50am/pm (not sure), put their camera down, did something on their laptop, then showed the laptop again possibly running something on linux.  


# BR005 – What Does It Mean?

The first mention of of “BR005” was on video “NC\_map\_color\_phase\_soon” uploaded on January 3rd. A google search revealed it was a possible flight number.

Here is a very interesting connection: [https://imgur.com/a/TR5vC6n](https://imgur.com/a/TR5vC6n) which is linked to the last file before the S McG channel was deleted: [https://imgur.com/a/sUvYNXC](https://imgur.com/a/sUvYNXC) 

I contacted the Los Angeles EVA Air office on January 5 and inquired why flight BR005 was cancelled. The agent said that they would check. A few seconds later she started breathing long, deep, audible breaths into the phone for what seemed like 2 minutes straight.

I was about to ask if she was ok or if she was still on the phone with me.

Moments later, the agent told me that this flight had not been cancelled but was in fact discontinued due to the Covid-19 pandemic – stating that they had to cut back on flights.

I asked this person when it was discontinued. They said, “It was discontinued from last year \[2019\] – and even the year before \[2018?!\]”

I asked her that I found that flight BR5 was still operational. This person told me Flight BR005 is the same thing as Flight BR5 but then started asking me where I got my information from. I told her (lying of course) that I believe I looked on their website. This person said it would be impossible and that they do not have information about discontinued flights on their site.

Again they asked me where I got this information from. I told them I found it on Trip.com and they began to write it off reminding me the flight was discontinued due to cut-backs on flight because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

# Follow The Money…?

Through documents obtained through the S McG YouTube page, I believe Anthony Warner was given 1.2 mil then betrayed and murdered.

I believe his associate ""LEE, Q - ACTIVE MSR OCT."" was the person that disabled the AT&T security system and gave them access to install SUNSTORM... he probably killed Warner.

Here is a document from the S McG channel:

[https://imgur.com/a/B9FaybA](https://imgur.com/a/B9FaybA) 

https://preview.redd.it/jxbyicazsma61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2fc0260eb0a8c95bdc296e0411f97a4549c4472

There is a Lee family (could be unrelated) that own 2 boutiques that were blown up right across the street. The $10 Store Boutique was owned since 2014, but if you look at their other store Ensemble, it was owned since 2018, yet according to google maps street view, it was vacant in July 2019.

The body cam footage shows the Ensemble Boutique in business the day of the bombing. At 1:55 take note that the officer approaches the RV and passes both the Ensemble and $10 Everything Boutiques:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO2WD\_9pCYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO2WD_9pCYY) 

Why would you own 2 boutiques that sell the same exact stuff and are located about 20 feet from each other? Seems like it would only create competition for yourself.

This should give you a visual on what I’m talking about:

https://preview.redd.it/tnuyf5c2tma61.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=f44ae5eb02c3190b6096cf56d1b1569dcda1d4e8

[https://imgur.com/a/I9seIQO](https://imgur.com/a/I9seIQO) 

The reviews on the Ensemble store are very strange. How did they get reviews from years ago when according to Google maps, they weren't even open last summer?

Here is the LEE RETAIL GROUP, LLC who owns DBA’s for “SIMPLY THE BEST $10 BOUTIQUE” and “ENSEMBLE”:

[https://tnbear.tn.gov/Ecommerce/FilingDetail.aspx?CN=014010062234253076008238253252014191145244170197](https://tnbear.tn.gov/Ecommerce/FilingDetail.aspx?CN=014010062234253076008238253252014191145244170197) 

Q Lee could possibly be related to that Mr and Mrs Lee who own those boutiques.

Keep in mind that the Ensemble boutique took the most damage out of any other building in the area including the ""intended"" AT&T target.

It almost appears that either the RV explosion deflected off of the AT&T building and focused on the Ensemble building at 174 2nd Avenue N or there was possibly explosive devices placed underground or within that building. If you look on Google Maps, there is in fact ventilation grates which suggests there is access to some underground area.

[https://www.google.com/maps/@36.1641167,-86.7765941,3a,46.7y,45.34h,72.47t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgqbURHpzbT63-5U4Avv7cQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.1641167,-86.7765941,3a,46.7y,45.34h,72.47t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgqbURHpzbT63-5U4Avv7cQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) 

    A little side note: Immediately after and during the FBI investigation, if you looked on Google Maps, the bomb location was always and has always been “174 2nd Ave N” and not the actual intended AT&T target building.

According to this recent post, the FBI is still not labeling the Nashville Bombing as an act of terror.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/krr3kv/fbi\_still\_not\_labeling\_nashville\_bombing\_as\_a\_act/](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/krr3kv/fbi_still_not_labeling_nashville_bombing_as_a_act/) 

**One user commented this which I found very interesting:**

>“Also a large reason they are kind of hesitant on labeling it as “terrorism” is because the businesses that got destroyed in the blast will not be covered by insurance if it is. Terrorism insurance is a separate thing and I don’t think any of the businesses that were destroyed had it from what I’ve read and seen on the news here in Nashville.”

.  
The GA, MI, PA, CA references are possibly linked to voting machines. TN towers could be a reference to the Tennessee Bombing and the “materials” could be the bomb. The AT&T Building is the tallest “tower” in Tennessee. It’s only located a block away and was affected by the explosion.  
.  
Email reply, “No we solved a problem for the five towers in TN, we have prepared all the materials to help solve this problem. AQW. In addition, if you need to contact LAKE HOUSE, since the aircraft crash incident, their chances are getting higher and they have been relocated in accordance with t XXXXXXXXXX Call them if absolutely need to +1 334 219 6725.”  
.  
The reply mentions aircraft crash. AQW could be a reference to Harriman and West Airport, North Adams in Massachusetts. Lake House was originally referenced in the 6JAN\_CARAVAN\_PLN video. In the video it said in Chinese characters, “DON’T BE NEAR THE RED LAKE HOUSE”. The phone number is assigned in Lafayette, Alabama.

# Who Will Carry The Torch?

Well, for now, this is all I have collected from all of the great contributors. So what else could be followed up with?

* Find the original Penglai video from the clip on 6JAN\_CARAVAN\_PLN and see what machine they are building, what product it manufactures, etc.
* Systematically click on each one of the YouTube videos (from an incognito window) on the mirror site [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChZcJ7NF0moCTzRoegn240A/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChZcJ7NF0moCTzRoegn240A/videos) and take a look at any of the suggested videos to see if anything sticks out or seems out of place. I wish the original S McG channel was still active as YouTube would have given more accurate “Suggested Videos”.
* Dig into “CAMCORDER TRUTH JIHAD”
* Dig into Flight BR005
* See if you can link anything between the TRIBE YouTube channel, New Jersey, and the S McG channel owner.
* Find cache or archive of the Ghost Dads 11.2.20 original podcast talking about the coronavirus and comparing Los Angeles to Wuhan.
* Are there any other S McG / G McS / McG channels of interest?
* Google/duckduckgo: “mcg”
* Google/duckduckgo: “mcg hackers”

There’s a million dollar bounty on my head yeah

You in the middle of it all

There’s a million dollar bounty on my head yeah

I can’t even tell you what I’ve done

I don’t even know you to be strong

Why the hell did I bring you along?

Ain’t this the part where you get gone from me?

They take everything I love away

I love away

There’s a million dollar bounty on my head yeah

You in the middle of it all

I don’t even know you to be strong

Why the hell did I bring you along?

The fuck is wrong with me?

Baby I got you a ticket to leave the country

I know you always wanted to see Rome

You got it going - get the fuck away from me

This how it gotta be

I knew you love it but you gotta go

It allows monitoring and lifecycle management of your resources and helps you identify critical issues before they affect your customers. **ServiceNow** is a cloud-based platform that helps enterprises improve the efficiency of their operations by workflow automation and streamlining of routine work tasks.

Different teams in large organizations often choose different tools to work with. So you might be using SolarWinds to monitor your enterprise infrastructure and ServiceNow to handle customer requests and issue alerts. However, if you are using both tools separately, you are most probably experiencing delays and data silos due to manual work.

If you integrate **ServiceNow** and **SolarWinds** and have them work seamlessly together, you can automate creating and handling of incidents and alerts and automate the transfer of critical data.

Using an integration platform can improve the collaboration between your teams and speed up issue resolutions.  A no-code integration platform, like **ZigiOps**, allows you to *seamlessly automate data transfer improve teamwork by connecting SolarWinds and ServiceNow*. You don’t need any coding knowledge to set up and deploy your integration with ZigiOps.

The integration platform automatically collects new Events and Alerts from SolarWinds and creates new Incidents or Changes in ServiceNow, based on your pre-defined conditions. All the necessary information from the fields you chose in advance will be transferred in real-time.

With our pre-built workflows, you get a wide set of actions, conditions, and transformations that are ready to use. Customize your integration to adapt it to your own needs and requirements, and make it fit your exact use case, regardless of its complexity. Synchronize your teams to solve your most pressing business challenges.

CISA advises stakeholders to read this Alert and review the enclosed indicators (see Appendix B).

>Key Takeaways (updated December 18, 2020)

>This is a patient, well-resourced, and focused adversary that has sustained long duration activity on victim networks.

>CISA is investigating other initial access vectors in addition to the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise. 

>Not all organizations that have the backdoor delivered through SolarWinds Orion have been targeted by the adversary with follow-on actions.

>Organizations with suspected compromises need to be highly conscious of operational security, including when engaging in incident response activities and planning and implementing remediation plans. 



>CISA is investigating incidents that exhibit adversary TTPs consistent with this activity, including some where victims either do not leverage SolarWinds Orion or where SolarWinds Orion was present but where there was no SolarWinds exploitation activity observed.

I'd be interested to see the implications of this, if any. I'm sure UCSD’s cybersecurity team is fully investigating this right now. Duo is used to authenticate *everything*, of particular interest to foreign agents would be the work going on in the SDSC and UCSD Health research labs, many projects that aren't public facing are run in these areas.

1701,kdxf5o,tanium,The SolarWinds Backdoor: What Should You Do?," **Overview**  


On December 13, 2020, FireEye [released a threat research alert](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) identifying a global campaign to infiltrate public and private organizations through “trojanized updates'' of the SolarWinds Orion IT monitoring and management software.  The campaign to inject a backdoor may have begun as early as Spring 2020.  The perpetrator of the effort is believed to be a state-sponsored actor who is both highly skilled and highly motivated. The most dangerous effects of this campaign are lateral movement within infiltrated networks and the exfiltration of data from the compromised networks. Commercial and Governmental alerts related to this event include:  
 

* CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) released an emergency [directive](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/) to remove any presence of this malicious code. 
* US-CERT [notification](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/12/13/active-exploitation-solarwinds-software)
* SolarWinds also issued a [security advisory](https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory) recommending their customers immediately upgrade to Orion Platform version 2020.2.1 HF 1. 
* SANS emergency [Webcast](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/emergency-webcast-about-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-118015): “What you need to know about the SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack”
* Countermeasures, signatures, rules, IOCs: [FireEye](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures), [DHS](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/)

Tanium can be used to identify where SolarWinds Orion products have been installed, help you prevent the hosts from communicating on the network as advised by US-CERT, and mitigate risk.  


**What happened?**  


FireEye confirmed that the *SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll* file is a SolarWinds digitally-signed component of the Orion software framework that contains a backdoor, which communicates via HTTP to third-party servers.  


After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it retrieves and executes commands, called “Jobs”, that include the ability to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the computer, and disable system services. The malware masquerades its network traffic as the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and stores reconnaissance results within legitimate plugin configuration files allowing it to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools running as processes, services, and drivers.  


**Why does this matter?**  


As per FireEye, this evasion and backdoor showcases evidence of a light malware footprint, going to great lengths to blend into normal enterprise network activity. It also showcases advanced offensive cyber activity including: cyber reconnaissance and surveillance (Cyber R&S), and operational discipline that obfuscates the penetration or bridgehead into the target networks.   


The usage of sophisticated tools and techniques increases the difficulty in attributing this event to a specific actor or adversary. However, this campaign is consistent with a heavily resourced nation-state that leveraged this backdoor to laterally move across the organization, and exfiltrate data of the purported victims out of their networks.   


FireEye has detected this activity at multiple entities worldwide. Their research confirmed that victims have included government, consulting, technology, telecom and extractive entities in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. SolarWinds has over 300,000 customers worldwide, and we believe this to be an extremely pervasive threat based on public research, reporting, and current information.  
**Strong mitigation actions include updating to the latest version of SolarWinds:** **Orion Platform version 2020.2.1 HF 1** **is highly recommended across your environment.**   


**Getting visibility into where SolarWinds products are installed in your environment**  


Due to the breadth and scope of this incident, there are many possible ways that Tanium can be leveraged to gain real-time visibility into the threat, mitigate it using various control mechanisms, and help prevent impacted hosts from communicating out of the network...

*Date \[standardized human time\]: 12:40 August 5, 2136*

The presentations the humans gave so far have been fascinating. The first was to give evidence of their empathy so that we would trust them. Humans have a strange ability to bond with any other creature, predator or prey, and have even subverted some of the fiercest predators into being their servants. The concept boggled my mind, since it supposed that humans could achieve stability by fully embracing their tainted nature. They claimed that they didn't like killing, but since their survival required it they would do so in ways that were quick and painless wherever they could.

The second presentation was to show the different hunting methods of predators they were familiar with. For instance, I now know that different predators have different hunting methods. These include ambush, pursuit, and overwhelming invasion. The humans claim to specialize in a very slow form of pursuit where they just keep following their prey till exhaustion. I have to admit that the idea of this is terrifying, and it hardly sounds like the ""quick and painless"" methods they claim to use now.

From there, they moved onto the third lecture, showing how each hunting method was emulated by humans in their own battle methods. It is incredible to me that they have incorporated each form of predation into their own.

I realize now that humanity is not just a predator species, but a race of super-predators, so overwhelmingly powerful that there simply would be no way for us to have resisted them if they chose. Tarva's gambit turned out to be much wiser than any of us had thought. Had we tried to resist, and burned those first two humans to land on Venlil Prime, the whole human species would have turned on us. I have no doubt the federation would have driven them back eventually, but not before they destroyed my world.

Now we were discussing human weaponry. I notice the majority of their weapons are projectile based, with a few energy weapons thrown in. But where were the flamers? How did they deal with predators they couldn't control? And what about other humans who had given into their bloodlust?

The response I got from the one called Azrael Sapir was... terrifying.

""YOU WILL NOT TALK ABOUT BURNING HUMANS!"" she shouted, her voice rising to a deafening volume. The six pointed star on her chest gleamed as she transfixed me in her glare.

""But, surely you have to be able to cleanse those who are unstable?""

""We do have a justice system, and there is a death penalty option, but it is not done with fire. Fire is one of the most painful, terrifying ways to die. It's inhumane, and only the worst kind of monster would even consider its use. Even in war, the use of fire as a weapon is considered an atrocity, something to be used only as a last resort, and only when you intend your enemy to die in the worst way imaginable.""

Those words cut me to the core. Fire was part of an exterminator's life. The flames cleansed and sanitized. Why then was this so different?

""Let me tell you a story"" the human weapons officer said, her features dark and foreboding. ""There was a human once who believed his people were superior to all others. Sadly, such beliefs aren't uncommon in human history, but this man took it to the next level. He ordered his country ""cleansed of taint"", calling it a ""final solution"". In the span of just a few years, over six million people would be rounded up and killed for the mere act of existing, but that wasn't enough for him. No, he had to prove his race was superior to the whole world."" The human woman paused for a moment. ""Over eighty MILLION people died in less than five years because of him. That number would stand over a hundred years, and it wasn't until the Satellite War that we even came close to that amount of dead.""

I blinked. Federation records said that the humans had destroyed themselves roughly between \[150 and 200 years\] ago. The conflict that the human woman referenced fell within that window. It must have been the same incident! There was no other explanation.

My revelation also brought with it a question...

""Is that why humans are willing to band together with prey species to fight the Arxur?""

The human woman made that strange head bobbing they do when answering in the affirmative. ""All indications are that the Arxur have the same belief that they are superior, and that everyone else is just food. Well, not only can we never again allow ourselves to be claimed by such darkness, but we will fight it anywhere we see it.""

As she spoke, the wrote something for the projector. Strangely, I noticed she wrote from right to left, while most humans wrote the opposite. When she was finished, she stepped aside to reveal her message.

  SolarWinds said Sunday in a statement that monitoring products it  released in March and June of this year may have been surreptitiously  weaponized in a **“highly-sophisticated, targeted . . . attack by a nation state.”**

 Did you get that? It was HIGHLY-SOPHISTICATED, so it had to be a NATION STATE, like Russia.  
 Even if we wanted to explain it to you, it would be too complicated for you to understand.

And all of this ""secured"" by a  password so simple an idiot could have created it.

>In a new wrinkle in the still-unfolding SolarWinds saga, it seems that some of **the company’s top investors sold off close to a collective $280 million dollars in stock just days before** the news of its role in a far-reaching federal cyberattack became public. That’s according to a new Washington Post report that specifically  calls out two investment firms—Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo—that together  own a whopping 70% of all SolarWind’s stock and controlled six of the  company’s board seats. The two firms sold off, respectively, $158  million dollars and $128 million dollars in shares on December 7—six  days before SolarWinds disclosed that some of its monitoring products  were subject to *a “highly-sophisticated” attack at the hands of an unnamed nation state.*  
 Interestingly enough, **these sales also happened just days before the company’s longterm CEO, Kevin Thompson, announced his resignation** after close to 10 years with the company.

**Memory transcription subject: Able Spaceman Johnathan Hopkins, destroyer UNSS Amatsukaze-Kai,** ***Venlil System***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: 0400, October 21, 2136*

I woke with my alarm, precisely one hour before Captain Hara. Carefully I dressed, making sure my uniform was immaculate. After that, it was the suit. I understand why the captain made it mandatory for everyone on shift to be suited up, but I wish I didn't have to. There was only so much the designers could do to make them comfortable.

Once my suit was on, I walked down to the mess for breakfast, checking and reading messages on my data pad on the way. Knowing we now had a few herbivore crewmembers, the cook had decided on having a vegan option ready for every meal, and today's offering was an oat based pancake, which I topped with black currant. Quite tasty, and fairly filling too. They went well with my tea.

I had about half an hour before I needed to be anywhere, so it was a good time to listen to the chatter of the crew as I had my breakfast.

Apparently the new venlil pilot was fitting in well. Chief Samuels was talking him up as he had his own breakfast of steak and eggs. The new pilot was sitting next to him, doing a rather impressive job of not looking too put-off by the jolly American. Strangely he seemed to have an orange tint to him whenever the chief would praise him.

The other venlil in the mess was a female named Sipha, who was watching two of the engineers playing chess. Maybe later I'd have to show them what a true master could do, but unfortunately there was only one other member of the crew who could match my skill on the board, and Lieutenant Wilhelm was typically occupied with one of his lovers (the XO, and his engines) so getting a game against him was difficult at best. I heard rumor that XO Sapir was improving dramatically though, so maybe I should test her.

I hadn't met the other three new xenos yet. I had hoped I would, but so far they had been on opposite shifts.

I finished my breakfast, and checked my watch again. Ten minutes, plenty of time. I stood and walked over to the cook, requesting the Captain's traditional breakfast. The cook handed me a box which contained rice, a generous piece of fish, pickles, and a scrambled egg. As usual, I grabbed a large bulb of black coffee for the captain, injecting two sugars into the bulb, just as he preferred. On my way back to the captain's room, I picked up a fresh uniform for him, and tucked it under my arm.

I arrived at the captain's room at precisely 0459. I took a few moments to make sure everything was in order, giving the coffee bulb a swirl to make sure the sugar hadn't settled out. I heard his alarm go off, and waited another minute before opening the door and stepping in unbidden.

""Good morning, Captain.""

""Ohayou, Johnathan-kun. Punctual as ever.""

I set his breakfast on his desk, then opened the uniform. Setting out each piece in the order he would need it. My captain stretched, freeing himself from the effects of sleep as he took the coffee from his desk and had a generous pull.

""So Johnathan, what have you heard new this morning?"" Captain Hara asked me as he began to dress himself.

""Well sir, our new pilot seems to be impressing Chief Samuels, but it looks like he is embarrassed by praise. Probably the type who just views it as doing his job.""

""I'll keep an eye on that, don't want the chief spoiling him too badly. What else?""

""Able Space-ven Sipha seems fascinated by chess. There could be a cross-train opportunity for her in tactical.""

""Interesting."" The captain smiled at me, knowing I wanted to be part of that as well. Captain Hara knew I could out think many of his officers on the board, and he had even been teaching me Shogi as a way for both of us to expand our thoughts.

""The crew seems to accept the new members, though I have heard a lot of rumblings about wanting to go out and take it to the Federation. Some of it seems a little out there.""

""Only fools seek to fight"" the captain said as he finished dressing and began to pull on his suit, he paused to take a few bites of his breakfast, then looked at me. ""Johnathan, why didn't you want to become an officer? You're one of the smartest people in this crew, and your work ethic is certainly good.""

""Well sir, I see what command does to you officers. You all get old and grey so fast.""

""Responsibility is a terrible thing, isn't it?""

""Aye, sir. Will you be needing anything else today, captain?

""Thank you Johnathan, but I should be good for a while. Please be about your business.""

""Aye, sir.""

I exited the captain's cabin and began making my rounds around the ship, bringing the crew the common things they didn't know they needed till I was there with them, and removing the byproducts of the daily routine. In the back of my mind was the message I had received from my true superiors at ONI warning that ""something was brewing"".

Every conversation today had to take on new meaning. Vague warnings aside, I would need to be vigilant.",34,1.0,1713189535,3

The first impact on VMware (VMW) was Friday when Brian Krebs (World renowned Cyber Security Investigative Reporter known for highly effective campaigns in tracking and neutralizing cybercriminal threats) tied the SolarWinds (SWI) based hacks to the VMware vulnerabilities reported by the NSA. This combination of capabilities explains persistence and how it was formed.

VMware (VMW) dropped 5.6% by end of day after the publication of the Krebs article.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990)

Patches already exist but VMware has found itself thrown into the fire of the SolarWinds hack. At this point since VMware was not a victim, but instead a utility, they may find themselves following the downward path of SolarWinds as the reputation of their Identity Management products takes a beating. 5.6% may be the beginning of a weeks long drop as customers reassess their ties to VMware identity management products and investors panic on the correlation to the SolarWinds hack.

**What is VMware?**

VMware provides the worlds premier virtualization software. ""VMware, Inc. engages in the provision of cloud infrastructure and business mobility. Its products include Software-Defined Data Center, Hybrid Cloud Computing, and End-User Computing. It supports modernizing data centers, integrating public clouds, empowering digital workspaces and transforming security."" -Forbes

**Who uses VMware?**

""More than 500,000 customers of all sizes have chosen VMware as their virtualization platform, including

• 99 percent of Fortune 100 companies  
• 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies  
• 100 percent of Fortune Global 100 companies • 99 percent of Fortune Global 500 companies""

VMware is also GSA approved and distributed through Dell (DELL), Carahsoft, and Ingram Micro/Promark and used by all levels of government and the US military.

[https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html)

**Who discovered the latest VMware vulnerabilities?**

The vulnerabilities were disclosed to VMware by the NSA. VMware subsequently disclosed to the public.

**What was the major exploit within VMware products?**

""A malicious actor with network access to the administrative configurator on port 8443 and a valid password for the configurator admin account can execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system.""

[https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html)

**How would someone be able to accomplish the exploit?**

You may be asking, how could someone accomplish a login to the administrative port of a VMware configuration with a valid password?

Well this is simple, SolarWinds Orion stores and utilizes the adequate credentials to monitor and maintain all devices placed within it's scope......including your VMware entities.

[https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success\_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm)

**So the VMware has been compromised, what can they really do?**

Through VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager the actor is able to create unauthorized but VALID SAML tokens which enable authentication to network resources. Once an administrative level authentication is established to resources such as Active Directory the actor is able to create persistence.

""It is critical when running products that perform authentication that the server and all the services that depend on it are properly configured for secure operation and integration. Otherwise, SAML assertions could be forged, granting access to numerous resources. If integrating authentication servers with ADFS, NSA recommends following Microsoft’s best practices, especially for securing SAML assertions and requiring multi-factor authentication""

[https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA\_VMWARE%20ACCESS\_U\_OO\_195076\_20.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA_VMWARE%20ACCESS_U_OO_195076_20.PDF)

**But did it really happen this way? Were the exploits chained?**

It seems so from all assessments. For all authenticators that could not be harvested from within SolarWinds, in the condition of existence of VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager served as the final hurdle to full domain control.

""The exploitation occurs after the actors have gained initial access to a victim’s on-premises network. The actors leverage privileged access in the on-premises environment to subvert the mechanisms that the organization uses to grant access to cloud and on-premises resources and/or to compromise administrator credentials with the ability to manage cloud resources.""

""In the first Tactics Techniques and Procedures, the actors compromise on-premises components of a federated SSO infrastructure and steal the credential or private key that is used to sign Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens (TA00061, T1552, T1552.004). Using the private keys, the actors then forge trusted authentication tokens to access cloud resources. A recent NSA Cybersecurity Advisory warned of actors exploiting a vulnerability in VMware Access®2 and VMware Identity Manager®3 that allowed them to perform this Tactics Techniques and Procedures and abuse federated SSO infrastructure""

""Regardless of how the initial on-premises compromise occurred, detecting authentication abuse can aid in detecting the compromise and even contain it if responded to quickly enough. The recent SolarWinds Orion®9 code compromise is one serious example of how on-premises systems can be compromised leading to abuse of federated authentication and malicious cloud access""

**Why would this shift VMware (VMW) stock price down if there is already a patch?**

VMware has gone from having patched an exploit disclosed to them by the NSA, to having been placed in the spotlight of previous and current utility by those that exploited the SolarWinds hack.

The NSA had already written very detailed documentation of how the VMware and SolarWinds exploits chained together but it had not proven digestible to most.

After Krebs wrote his article it brought up questions within consumers of VMware products of why they needed their version of identify as a service (IDaaS) for their single sign-on. This sentiment moved forward into investors and we saw a 5.6% drop in VMware (VMW) stock by end of day.

It is highly likely that as SolarWinds falls on news of the hack that now that VMware has been identified in the same exploit chain they may fall with it.

WMware thankfully were quick to disclose their own vulnerability, and none of their board attempted to exit their positions before that disclosure. This is the opposite of what had been done by SolarWinds, with whom they have now been linked by technical means.

We may see a further fall in VMware stock price on Monday and throughout the upcoming weeks as a result of the above information.

**Updates will come.**

What Happened: Nobelium, the group behind the SolarWinds cybersecurity attack, now targets government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations, Microsoft said in a blog post on Thursday. 

Russian-based Nobelium has targeted around 3,000 email accounts across more than 150 different organizations, Microsoft said. 

The Nobelium carried out these attacks by breaking into an email marketing account called Constant Contact, used by the United States Agency For International Development (USAID). It then sent phishing emails that looked authentic but contained malicious content, Microsoft said.

Tom Burt, Microsoft vice president of customer security and trust, wrote in the blog that at least a quarter of the targeted organizations were involved in international development, humanitarian issues, and human rights work.

Microsoft said it was in the process of notifying all of its targeted customers and had ""no reason to believe"" these attacks involved any exploitation or vulnerability in Microsoft's products or services.

I am looking for similar technical explanation of course. It is clear that  their patch server had poor password so that probably allowed the hackers to get in. But it does not explain how they managed to find more loopholes to take over the server and the orion update software  saved in it.

I am also not clear as to how malicious actors could gain access to more devices and hosts in network once they managed to have the backdoor ridden orion software installed  in 18000 companies. That certainly will give them access to a vast zombie network but how could they spread beyond the infected device?",1,0.67,1608203739,3

I've actually never purchased anything from them, nor have I signed up for any trials, but still, somehow they had gotten my info.

I had looked into their products, but decided they were too limited/fragmented for our needs, and then made a search that brought me to this Subreddit and multiple posts warning against Solarwinds.

So I wrote them and basically asked them to fuck off, and was pleasantly surprised they seemingly respected that (hadn't expected that, after reading about them on this Subreddit and elsewhere).

Friday I got a call from a guy from 'Solar'. He didn't pronounce their Company name very clearly (wonder why) so I asked him to spell it.

So I said: 'Solar? Like Solarwinds?'. which he confirmed but explained that Solarwinds is the parent company (I'm located in Europe).

I told him about the mail I had send back in April 2020 and told him that their recent security breaches, and their handling of them (blaming an intern), most certainly hadn't changed my opinion of them - quite the contrary.

He told me he was SO glad I mentioned that, because that gave him an opportunity to clarify that the security breach was limited to the US part of Solarwinds, and that the EU part of Solarwinds was unaffected.

At that point I asked him to stop talking and never call me again.

Some agencies affected were those tasked with detecting SolarWinds-type cyber breaches.","Original Comment at: /r/AskALiberal/comments/kgcp5g/do_you_think_trump_is_complicit_in_the_solarwinds/

The question was: 

> Do you think Trump is complicit in the SolarWinds hack? Do you think the Biden administration should appoint a special counsel to investigate the hack?

Complicit? Perhaps by pushing his wall and gutting all other programs, yes.   Whatever the root cause (incompetence or deliberate actions or cronyism) it's clear that ""the wall"" was a boondoggle that made the US weaker because the urgent issues facing US security was not migrants avoiding regular ports of crossing. So he's as ""complicit"" in this as he's complicit in the COVID outbreak in the US due to Trump's decision to disband the [US Pandemic Response Team](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/).

Supporting Evidence: 
Trump made his [wall decree in 2017](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/2018_blueprint.pdf) with the instruction to pull money out cybersecurity to pay for it. 

Did this reduction allow the attack?  The answer is found within the DHS FY 2018 budget publication. 

The *hundreds of millions of dollars* were pulled from the VERY departments tasked with monitoring for this kind of stuff and it ZEROED OUT THE BUDGET for some of the programs designed to stop/detect these kind of attacks.  From the document....

* Total funding changes: Decrease, ($99,969k)  The funding decrease in Research, Development and Innovation will be applied across the six thrusts: Apex, Cargo Security, Chemical, Biological and Explosive Defense Research and Development, Counter Terrorist, **Cyber Security/Information Analysis, and First Responders/Disaster Resilience**.  In order to maximize available research and development funding, S&T leadership has prioritized projects to support Administration and Secretarial immigration and **border security priorities.** [source](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/S%26T%20FY18%20Budget.pdf)

* Cut: Cyber Security/Information Analysis – a decrement of $20.234M **eliminates** Cyber Security Research Infrastructure and Cyber Transition and Outreach investment to focus on Administration and Secretarial priorities, including **immigration and border security**.  [Same Source](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/S%26T%20FY18%20Budget.pdf)

* Reduced Funding: Mission 4:  Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace: The Program identifies, funds, and coordinates cyber security research and development resulting in deployable security solutions. These solutions include user identity and data privacy technologies, **end system security**, research infrastructure, law enforcement forensic capabilities, secure protocols, **software assurance**, and cybersecurity education. [Cut 20% from $86,483k in FY 2017 to $58,248k in FY 2018](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/S%26T%20FY18%20Budget.pdf)

* Cyber Security Research Infrastructure – FY 2017 Annualized Continuing Resolution: $10.847M.  **FY 2018 Request: $0**.  This program provides the infrastructure necessary to support the R&D that is critical for matching and adapting cyber threats.  Much like testing for CBE R&D, special testbeds and data sets must be made available to the cyber research community, and unlike CBE, there is not a large selection of facilities or capabilities like missile ranges or BSL-4 laboratories that can be used to safely test malicious code somewhere other than on the live Internet or on real data.

And these kinds of programs are EXACTLY the kind of R&D cyberthreat analysis that is designed to look for 0 day security risks from all software (3rd party and in-house).",1,1.0,1689951723,3

Solarwinds thinks this back door was setup back in March. They were not the ones that reported the finding so their entire network could be compromised since these actors had more than 8 months to play around on their network.

Their K-8 report shows that their emails were compromised. I am sure they use the same email accounts to manage the RMM portal so these actors could potentially have access to RMM. If you’re using these products are you shutting them down or just trying to monitor them at this point?

Edit: Recent update from Solarwinds. So far no evidence other products were compromised.

Targets of the operation consist of victims in Ukraine and select English-speaking countries like the U.K.

“Given the geography of the targets and the current geopolitical situation, it’s unlikely that the RomCom RAT threat actor is cybercrime-motivated,” the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team said in a new analysis.

The latest findings come a week after the Canadian cybersecurity company disclosed a spear-phishing campaign aimed at Ukrainian entities to deploy a remote access trojan called RomCom RAT.

The unknown threat actor has also been observed leveraging trojanized variants of Advanced IP Scanner and pdfFiller as droppers to distribute the implant.

The latest iteration of the campaign entails setting up decoy lookalike websites with a similar domain name, followed by uploading a malware-laced installer bundle of the malicious software, and then sending phishing emails to targeted victims.

2038,myyxif,cybersecurity,Questions about the Solarwinds breach,"**Major question: How to stop the SolarWinds breach from happening again?**

These questions may be geared to SOC teams or cybersecurity analysts in general. I'm only a networking guy that has some cybersecurity questions.

From what I've read, the SolarWinds breach was able to steal so much information without being noticed with the **"".avsvmcloud\[.\]com""** DNS name (Microsoft owns the domain now). I have a few questions and some might not be able to be answered.

1. Why did DPL policies not pick up on this attack?
   1. Was the bandwidth too low?
   2. Was it encrypted so that inspection wouldn't see it?
   3. Was the data sent out a little at a time so it wouldn't be noticed?
2. Did normal people push this aside because they thought it was just normal SolarWinds traffic?
3. **Now for the big question, How are modern security teams going to protect against another supply chain threat like this from happening again? Assuming supply chain attacks are only going to increase because of the amount of information that could be captured.**

Less important questions:

1. Why wasn't this domain checked to verify it was owned by SolarWinds or another software vendor on the servers? or was it?
2. Why don't server admins email SolarWinds directly to ask if this domain is used by the Orion platform?
3. Would SolarWinds support even know that the domain was being used maliciously when asked?",3,0.72,1619447317,3

2063,ke9mvl,conspiracy,What if the SolarWinds trojan wasn't injected by black hats but by white hats?,"So, as most will admit, things look pretty bleak for Trump. He's lost in courts, he's lost his support in the Senate, the states have certified its electors (albeit some states did certify alternate electors), Bill Barr said he saw no massive evidence of fraud, and hell, even Fox turned on him. But the one thing that has puzzled me is how nonchalant carefree and confident he is. Especially his team of lawyers, especially people like Sidney Powell, just don't seem despondent at all. And every day since the election, he's said some cryptic shit. Things like ""you'll find out"" and ""I know who's going to get inaugurated but I don't wanna say it now"". Why?

Trump and his team have been stating they have irrefutable proof the election was stolen but have not yet provided any evidence to the public. Now, I'm not talking about the sworn affidavits of 100s of witnesses. I'm not talking about statisticians who've analyzed the anomalies. I'm not talking about the computer forensic auditors who discovered the 68% adjudication error rates in the Michigan machines. I'm talking about DIRECT evidence from the White House itself. After all, we know that Trump knew for years that fraud was likely to occur this election. In fact, he issued executive order 13848 way back in 2018 to declare a state of emergency to combat foreign intervention in US elections. So WHY? Why hasn't the White House, who has the full power of monitoring of the country through the NSA, DOD, DOJ, and countless other agencies (CIA and FBI are a different story. Don't make me go there) produced any evidence yet? Maybe because the evidence was obtained though questionable/illegal means.

We all know from Snowden whistle blowing that illegal monitoring happens all the time. If phone conversations are recorded, you would think internet traffic is CERTAINLY monitored. Do we really believe that the NSA isn't tracking all internet traffic all the time?

Couple of days ago, it was revealed that SolarWinds and specifically, their Orion product, was infected with malware. This trojan was propagated so vastly that virtually all US govt systems were infected. We also know for a fact that Dominion systems used SolarWinds (although as my IT buddy pointed out, it was unclear if it used Orion specifically). What people don't know is that SolarWinds' main function is to log and monitor internet traffic to that server, especially unusual traffic. If the trojan came, not from a hostile country as the media reports, but from our own govt agency, then they would have seen EVERYTHING in real time as it happened on election night. They would have recorded all the vote as they were tallied in real time by each machine. But the evidence would be illegally obtained.

So how do you admit illegally obtained evidence to a court of law without it being thrown out? Well, disguise it as legally obtained evidence of course. So here's a plausible scheme to turn illegal evidence in to legal evidence.

1. Inject trojan in to all voting machines 
2. Have the data from machines collected from not within the US, but set up a shop in a friendly ally country, say... oh I dunno... Germany?
3. Have news leaked that servers in Germany which were operated by hostile forces were raided and obtained.
4. Launch the news that SolarWinds was hacked. Why, because you need people to be aware that the voting machines were compromised. They need to be convinced of this. Otherwise, they would dismiss any data of fraud as made up.
5. Present the servers that were raided in Germany. Show that the data was collected through the malware from a hostile force that was operating there. INVOKE EO 13848.
6. Using the emergency powers, Trump could then round up all conspirators and siege all evidence involved in the scheme to steal the election.

Finally, here are some reasons why I think this theory has some merit. Supposedly, nearly all govt servers were compromised because of the SolarWinds hack. Yet.... no damage, well none that are public, have occurred. Weird, no?  Think of it. Every system, including major banks, major social media companies, and internet companies were infected. Yet no real damages were reported. And the trojan was injected months ago!  And the news of the hack comes out just in time as the state electorates are certified. Trump's lawyer Lin Wood has been stating over and over again (as well as Trump) that by certifying illegal electorate, the governors are committing a crime and that they knew who they were. Trump now has until Jan 6, when the US House and Senate count the electoral votes and certify once and for all the results of this election. That's 3 weeks. Plenty of time to release the evidence to courts and have a ruling. Why did Trump's team focus so hard on getting states to send alternative electors to DC? Because without those alternate electors, even if Trump proves undeniable evidence to courts, he can't win except through a contingent vote of the House. And with the House being controlled by the Democrats, you can bet your life that they would fight tooth and nail to avoid that vote because it's ONE vote per state and the majority of states are Republican.  If he as alternate electors already, he doesn't have to go through any of that. President of the Senate, which happens to be our VP Pence, has the power to choose which electorates are valid and which are not. If courts rule in favor of Trump, Pence simply needs to say the alternate electors are the valid electors as ruled by SCOTUS. Game over.",50,0.79,1608127069,3

AskALiberal

I have quoted u/Lighting word for word here for those that do not want to click on the link.

“In some places people call me ""liberal"" in others they call me ""conservative"" so I hope I can still answer this question.

Complicit? Perhaps by pushing his wall and gutting all other programs, yes.   Whatever the root cause (incompetence or deliberate actions or cronyism) it's clear that ""the wall"" was a boondoggle that made the US weaker because the urgent issues facing US security was not migrants avoiding regular ports of crossing. So he's as ""complicit"" in this as he's complicit in the COVID outbreak in the US due to Trump's decision to disband the US Pandemic Response Team.

Supporting Evidence: Trump made his wall decree in 2017 with the instruction to pull money out cybersecurity to pay for it.

Did this reduction allow the attack?  The answer is found within the DHS FY 2018 budget publication.

The hundreds of millions of dollars were pulled from the VERY departments tasked with monitoring for this kind of stuff and it ZEROED OUT THE BUDGET for some of the programs designed to stop/detect these kind of attacks.  From the document....

•	⁠Total funding changes: Decrease, ($99,969k)  The funding decrease in Research, Development and Innovation will be applied across the six thrusts: Apex, Cargo Security, Chemical, Biological and Explosive Defense Research and Development, Counter Terrorist, Cyber Security/Information Analysis, and First Responders/Disaster Resilience.  In order to maximize available research and development funding, S&T leadership has prioritized projects to support Administration and Secretarial immigration and border security priorities. source
•	⁠Cut: Cyber Security/Information Analysis – a decrement of $20.234M eliminates Cyber Security Research Infrastructure and Cyber Transition and Outreach investment to focus on Administration and Secretarial priorities, including immigration and border security.  Same Source

This program provides the infrastructure necessary to support the R&D that is critical for matching and adapting cyber threats.  Much like testing for CBE R&D, special testbeds and data sets must be made available to the cyber research community, and unlike CBE, there is not a large selection of facilities or capabilities like missile ranges or BSL-4 laboratories that can be used to safely test malicious code somewhere other than on the live Internet or on real data.

And these kinds of programs are EXACTLY the kind of R&D cyberthreat analysis that is designed to look for 0 day security risks from all software (3rd party and in-house).

2205,n1tpv0,Wallstreetsilver,The consensus of recent major global studies of generation costs is that wind and Solar Power( Silver ) are the lowest-cost sources of electricity available today.," Cost of electricity by source

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[Jump to navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#mw-head)[Jump to search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#searchInput)*For the price of electricity, see* [*Electricity pricing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing)*.*

Different methods of [electricity generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation) can incur significantly different costs, and these costs can occur at significantly different times relative to when the power is used. The costs include the initial [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(finance)), and the costs of continuous [operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_costs), [fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel), and [maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations) as well as the costs of de-commissioning and remediating any environmental damage. Calculations of these costs can be made at the point of connection to a load or to the electricity grid, so that they may or may not include the transmission costs.

For comparing different methods, it is useful to compare costs per unit of energy which is typically given per [kilowatt-hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour) or [megawatt-hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawatt-hour). This type of calculation assists policymakers, researchers and others to guide discussions and decision making but is usually complicated by the need to take account of differences in timing by means of a [discount rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_effective_discount_rate). The consensus of recent major [global studies of generation costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#Global_studies) is that [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power) and [solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power) are the lowest-cost sources of electricity available today.",23,0.8,1619788893,3

2229,lohwav,ledgerwallet,"If SolarWinds was a supply chain attack that had a huge reach, couldn’t this happen to Ledger and our devices?","EDIT:
To add more details, Solar Winds was a supply chain attack where (allegedly) Russia's GRU unit was able to add malicious code into Solar Winds' software, which was then downloaded as an update by gov't agencies and companies. From there, they were able to access data and so on.

Plus, in light of recent North Korean hackers charged in cryptocurrency schemes (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/north-korean-hackers-charged-in-massive-cryptocurrency-theft-scheme.html), the scenario where Ledger's software supply chain gets compromised is within reach. Plus, there are eastern European syndicates that are highly motivated to do this, too. Also, read this article for a recent example about a supply-chain attack that affected Paypal and 34 other companies: https://threatpost.com/supply-chain-hack-paypal-microsoft-apple/163814/

# Now let me paint a potential doomsday scenario:
Say one of Ledger's internal libraries/packages gets compromised, and it makes it out into everyone's Ledger device as the latest firmware. Now let's say this malicious code just grabs the private keys and sends the data to a server once the Ledger device is connected to the internet. It doesn't matter what address is shown on your screen. Just wait a few days/weeks, and in one fell swoop, drain everyone's cryptocurrency.",3,0.8,1613858680,3
